# PSC0 SH/1 implementation work state

Updated: 2026-10-09 UTC.

## Active M6 implementation checkpoint (2026-10-09)

Work continues on isolated branch `psc0/sh1-ir-checker-v1`, descending from
integration documentation commit `829a2e953895f03225a77425141aa3ded5e78694`.
The qualified E source and selected A seed below remain unchanged.

The coherent M6 change adds neutral portable type operations, an explicit input
size preflight and a task-stack expression checker beside the existing IR model.
It checks global value/function distinctions, lexical bindings, simultaneous
generic substitution, exact function grouping, every body/initializer annotation,
layout ownership and fields, match coverage and intrinsic operand/result types.
Unknown types, unsupported scalar/import capabilities and exhausted resources
remain explicit failures. Empty inductives/matches are outside this checkpoint's
active emission contract.

A separate checked emission API checks the exact IR it emits. The cloud driver
uses the same portable check-before-emit rule for current generations and retains
explicit authenticated historical seed boundaries. The host adapter validates
same-compiler record/constructor brands and canonical scalar carriers; it supplies
no independent expression typing rules.

Validation is architecture-first: independent source reviews, a native exact-source
IR gate and focused native/generated conformance matrix, followed by the planned
C1/C2/C3 and pinned-provider checkpoint. Results are pending; implementation is
not qualification. No strict profile is activated and no provider or lowering
preservation claim is inferred from runtime type acceptance. Resource counters
distinguish input-shape, dispatcher and individual type-operation budgets; finding
counts count failed checking obligations, with first error within a type operation.

### First cloud execution and complete source-form repair

Implementation checkpoint `7f6d7474864cb06b534f119f528afa4bc6a3c3db`
ran in [37902919310](https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/actions/runs/37902919310).
The native Lean build passed all 133 jobs. The first native-candidate PSC parse
then stopped at Check.lean:160:29 on a parenthesized typed lambda argument.
No new checker conformance, full-source IR acceptance, C1/C2/C3 or provider
qualification was earned in that run. Its logged 245-plus-19 inventory belongs
to the retained A seed artifact, not to the current M6 source.

A grammar audit identified the whole class: seven callbacks in Check.lean and
nine in CheckTypes.lean. All are now explicitly typed local let initializers
passed by name, preserving their bodies and signatures. This uses the existing
full-term let-RHS parser; it adds no parser capability or typing exception.
The development command also builds `psc1_ir_check_tests`, matching CI.
The follow-up checkpoint `ccb8ba00ddf677327b4c38a0d6a4a459b83f51f8`
passed raw PSC parsing and another 133-job native build in
[run 37903821319](https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/actions/runs/37903821319).
It stopped during PSC elaboration of `psIrCheckMatchBindings` with
`matchExpectedType`, before any checker acceptance gate.

The elaborator requires an expected result type for matches. An unannotated
let initializer supplies none. All four direct let-bound matches in Check.lean
now explicitly state their existing result types; the other four new portable
modules contain no instance of this inference class. The follow-up changes no
checker rule or elaborator behavior. Current-source qualification remains pending.

Checkpoint `ce11b93f1f824ccb5a8acb1b43d5f47d05ecbb26` passed native
compilation again in [run 37904253709](https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/actions/runs/37904253709)
and cleared `matchExpectedType`, then exposed `unknownName:options` in the
same helper. Source tracing proved a normalizer omission: all original
parameters are renamed, but dotted parameter references retain the old receiver.
Nine sites in two new recursive functions are affected. Three typed branch-local
aliases preserve those receivers without changing recursion, checking rules or
resource accounting. This compatibility spelling remains consumable by selected
seed A; the general normalizer itself is unchanged in this M6 checkpoint.

A future projection-renaming capability must preserve exact qualified-name
resolution priority and local shadowing, and handle multi-segment internal
parameter names. Do not invent named getters for these PSC structures: this
frontend installs type, constructor and recursor declarations, and handles
field syntax directly. Qualification of the alias repair remains pending.
Attempt evidence is retained in
[runtime-ir-checker-execution.json](docs/selfhost-language/runtime-ir-checker-execution.json).

## Current source and qualification checkpoints

The current qualified portable source is the recursive generic-argument repair E,
`cf8fbd784944a98b1e390b709685ca54c2511827`. It was independently qualified on
`psc0/sh1-generic-erasure-v1`: compiler and pinned-provider jobs passed on the
first execution of [run 37852341550](https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/actions/runs/37852341550).
Its parent helper migration H,
`671685c3f0059574405a1e630dd965d421a26f05`, independently passed both jobs on
the first execution of [run 37851669475](https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/actions/runs/37851669475).

The canonical integration branch is `psc0/sh1-implementation-v1`; integration
preserves the E branch's source/qualification provenance and uses a normal
fast-forward. Documentation-only descendants do not change the qualified
portable source.

| Checkpoint | Source commit | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A: recursion capability and preparation/session implementation | `e91b9558d665879871b8bf0893915ae64b27c7fe` | Compiler-qualified and exact admissions accepted; remains the selected authoring seed |
| B: Foundation.List migration | `70d6010ddccbdd6b4939f2fb3c088bfe4e607de0` | Compiler-qualified and exact admissions accepted on its first migration execution |
| H: three compiler helpers | `671685c3f0059574405a1e630dd965d421a26f05` | Compiler-qualified and exact admissions accepted on its first execution |
| E: recursive generic-argument erasure | `cf8fbd784944a98b1e390b709685ca54c2511827` | Compiler-qualified and exact admissions accepted on its first execution |

Compiler qualification, Core-provider acceptance and strict runtime SH/1 remain
separate axes. Strict SH/1 is still false, and psconfig retains the existing PSC1
bootstrap lane. No named profile was activated by these changes.

## Completed implementation in this continuation

The helper migration H changes only `Elab/Term.lean` and
`Erasure/Definition.lean` inside the portable closure:

- `psExprApplyManyWorker` now takes its expression accumulator as an ordinary
  explicit parameter.
- `psExprAppViewAccWorker` now takes its argument accumulator as an ordinary
  explicit parameter.
- `psErasureAddUniqueStringWorker` now takes its changing candidate base as an
  ordinary explicit parameter while descending through Nat fuel.

All public worker/wrapper names, complete types, argument order and algorithms
are preserved. The unique-name helper retains its exact zero-fuel and collision
exhaustion suffixes. The three guards accept historical and qualified forms
while retaining wrapper, primitive and unrelated source/admission checks.

The correspondence gate compiles preserved/current raw helper slices with actual
Name/Level/Expr dependencies. It checks seven public types and 2,198 observations
per compiled slice, including typed partial applications. A separate 1,568-observation
check exercises actual exported helpers in each generated compiler. All of these
checks passed on the first compiler execution of both H and E.

The isolated E repair changes `Erasure/Basic.lean`, `Erasure/Definition.lean`
and `Erasure/Expr.lean`. `PsErasureCurrentDefinition` now retains a reversed
accumulator of the current declaration's generic arguments. Type binders record
their assigned Tn in order; runtime and erased proof binders preserve the context.
Recursive induction-hypothesis calls receive the restored declaration order.
The implementation neither captures unrelated local types nor whitelists helper
names.

The focused fixture checks exact original-IR argument order for one, two and
three generics, interleaved proposition/proof/runtime binders, and a monomorphic
control. It emits the same IR object whose calls were asserted. All N1/C1/C2/C3
executions passed 19 behavior observations; N1/C1 also passed native parity.
Kernel/provider implementation and metatheory were unchanged.

## H evidence before the erasure repair

H's compiler job `113565800146` passed on its first execution in
[run 37851669475](https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/actions/runs/37851669475);
provider job `113583716467` also passed on that first execution.

H contains 56 raw modules / 991,563 Git blob bytes, a reduction of 327 bytes
from B. Raw source closure SHA256:
`03c493835b44507fbe692f065f953f9c8252a44edcdf7e62932c3608831d0903`.
C1/C2/C3 agree on canonical surface, ordered admissions, TypeScript and JavaScript.
N1's TypeScript/JavaScript also agree with the generated generations.
The generated JavaScript SHA256 is
`fb7708698c333c1985ae82c0eb5b061c8738f41feffc12f3fddccb1c74fc6855`.

All three full-source inventories complete with 244 expression-typing obligations
and 19 type-argument arity findings. E's isolated repair resolves the latter
category below. H recovered the pinned A seed from its verified cache.

The unchanged pinned provider accepted H's two deduplicated compiler/capability
admission streams after emission. Its preserved receipts are
[qualification](docs/selfhost-language/helper-migration-qualification.json),
[helper correspondence](docs/selfhost-language/helper-migration-correspondence.json),
[small compiler receipts](docs/selfhost-language/helper-migration-compiler-evidence.json)
and [provider acceptance](docs/selfhost-language/helper-migration-provider.json).
The provider identity and checked-emission boundary are the same as E below.

## E evidence and the remaining runtime boundary

Run 37852341550: compiler job `113568120771` and provider job
`113579690742` both succeeded on the first execution.

E contains 56 raw modules / 992,338 Git blob bytes. Raw source closure SHA256:
`d7866a3c8da745db5b0f6c7ce67381915f6265263615c13a243ec674c1ab13e2`.

C2 and C3 agree on canonical surface, ordered admissions, TypeScript and
JavaScript. Their generated JavaScript SHA256 is
`b6783f5d3ae25fe2da233da3a2c607445efa007a62bbde0275cfa6b8b8b04816`;
native-generated N1 has the same JavaScript bytes. C1's JavaScript is
`d3fd03481ce03d4d2f962f932d4987aff28a7dcf68a395467be2dc57f1d60a2c`.
Its difference is permitted by the C2-versus-C3 contract: the older Q produced
C1's IR, while the new C1 executable contains the repaired erasure used for C2.

The complete C2/C3 IR inventories have **zero type-argument arity findings** and
**244 call-expression typing obligations**, with no other recorded categories.
C1 retains the historical 19 type-argument arity findings in its Q-produced IR.
B's 244-plus-19 result and its empty generic erasure context are historical;
the new repair must not be listed as future work again. The remaining 244
records identify unfinished expression typing, not 244 proven runtime failures.

The unchanged pinned provider source is
`963030dc2d154008fccc82e7c8ed29331f138799`, with binary SHA256
`88f2d20ea733742d48724ecbdc903271e18bcfcccc8682be596a676aef68e3ec`.
It accepted three deduplicated streams: E compiler admissions, raw .lean/.ps
capabilities, and the focused generic-erasure fixture. Default fuel 131,072 and
timeout 60,000 ms were unchanged. Emission preceded this separate check;
`emissionWasGatedByThisCheck` remains false.

Exact qualification, correspondence, compiler and provider receipts are indexed
in [docs/selfhost-language/qualification-evidence.json](docs/selfhost-language/qualification-evidence.json).
E's preserved receipts include
[qualification](docs/selfhost-language/recursive-generic-erasure-qualification.json),
[C2 generic conformance](docs/selfhost-language/recursive-generic-erasure-conformance.json),
[small compiler receipts](docs/selfhost-language/recursive-generic-erasure-compiler-evidence.json)
and [provider acceptance](docs/selfhost-language/recursive-generic-erasure-provider.json).

## Seed, development workflow and next work

The selected authoring compiler Q remains A from
`e91b9558d665879871b8bf0893915ae64b27c7fe`, with JavaScript SHA256
`9d8a91e890c779c6b377b8a482ae3e997a1630b360eb8d6e7c022b3964510096`.
Do not silently promote E as the seed or claim the historical S0 can consume
the migrated source. Preserve the authenticated S0 -> A recovery route and A's
qualified seed cache/artifact identities.

Ordinary edits use `npm run dev:sh1`; `npm run iterate:sh1 -- ... --loop`
provides optional resident preparation reuse. Full runs also execute the bounded
native gate before expensive selected-Q generation. Source-family and semantic
milestones receive C1/C2/C3 plus exact provider checks, selected by
`[sh1-qualify]` or full manual dispatch. Independent checkpoint branches may
qualify in parallel. Both new checkpoints passed their native, compiler and
provider gates on their first execution, without a semantic test/fix cycle.

H's bounded native gate took 39.951 seconds, and E's took 25.886 seconds.
Full C1/C2/C3 generation totals were 993.651/1,011.667/991.582 seconds for H and
607.562/606.556/632.401 seconds for E. These are recorded single-run scopes,
not a benchmark or a general speedup claim. The earlier 14.590-second
development result used a smaller bounded gate; warm resident preparation
measurements exclude source reads and optional emission.

The active M6 implementation follows
[docs/selfhost-language/RUNTIME_IR_PLAN.md](docs/selfhost-language/RUNTIME_IR_PLAN.md).
Its portable expression checker covers the current IR, with scoped simultaneous
type substitution, checked body/initializer annotations, exact function grouping,
global value/function distinction and explicit resource failures. The host
inventory reports that portable checker; qualification results are pending above.

Strict runtime enforcement additionally needs enabled primitive/layout/import
and scalar/bounds/text-position contracts, erasure/backend correspondence and
generated evidence for the enforced path. Neither zero type-arity findings nor
Core admission acceptance grants strict SH/1. Broader optional source conveniences
and .ps authority remain separately gated future work.

## Scope of this work

Implement the accepted self-host authoring and iteration plan from research commit
80d04e7ab0e9214ffecf093a6272865f0eaca096. Start with ordinary structural recursion
that changes nondependent value parameters, a pure preparation seam, and focused
generated-compiler qualification. Migrate source families only after capability
evidence passes.

Current M6 execution branch: psc0/sh1-ir-checker-v1.
Qualified integration branch: psc0/sh1-implementation-v1.
Historical compiler baseline: 37f63c39d4a07189938046c64152bba25d789450.
The historical 55-module record remains immutable.

## Boundaries

- GitHub/cloud only; no local checkout, builds or tests.
- Kernel/provider implementation and metatheory belong to the native workstream.
- No profile activation or checked/native success claim without corresponding evidence.
- Keep current public compiler APIs and source signatures compatible.
- Solve shared semantic/architectural causes; do not weaken gates to obtain a pass.
- Use focused validation for a complete implementation slice, then current-source
  C2/C3 qualification at the milestone.

## Historical execution notes

The following notes retain their original execution-time status from the initial
implementation and first migration. Pending statements below are historical;
the current checkpoint and next work are stated above.

### Implemented architecture

- Recursion: canonical stable/major worker plus function-valued generalized state;
  preserve public binder kinds and argument order with a wrapper. Reject unsupported
  dependent telescopes and escaping self references.
- Provenance: inspect and enforce which nested matches may introduce decreasing children.
- Preparation: pure start/parsed-step/source-step/finish with both environment and
  ordered declaration accumulator. Session caches retain a valid exact-source prefix
  within one compiler import.
- Qualification: pinned historical seed; isolated TypeScript5.8.3 installation;
  branch-scoped cloud workflow; raw .lean/.ps capability examples; candidate execution;
  explicit C2/C3 canonical source/admission/TS/JS equality.
- Native integration coordination: observed branch psc0/native-core-selfhost-v1 at
  963030dc2d154008fccc82e7c8ed29331f138799. Named native workflow run37825822957,
  job113478295740 completed its actual full checked compiler fixedpoint successfully.
  Source hash ee6dd22f1b74b97113cc1a5e36aadad3cceecb2b152653f2c0dc26dd07aa22f7;
  TypeScript hash fb173a348d1555d1ff224b9977f6fee68591b79f781a6b292c2572648415b033.
  This is evidence for the historical native baseline, not acceptance of our new worker
  admissions. New admissions will be checked through a separate pinned provider checkout.

### Design clarification

Canonical surface source is the output of the existing syntax translator. Lowered
worker/core structure is represented by canonical admissions. The minimum checkpoint
does not add a second elaboration-aware source printer. Generated compilers must
consume raw authored forms, so the new lowering path is exercised directly.

### Initial implementation checkpoint (historical)

The first coherent implementation checkpoint contains portable recursion lowering,
preparation/session reuse, raw capability fixtures, C2/C3 qualification, diagnostic IR
inventory and a separate pinned native-provider acceptance job. Its commit requests
[sh1-qualify]; compiler and provider outcomes are pending cloud execution. After earned capability
qualification, migrate a bounded Foundation.List family using a pinned qualified seed.
The independent host IR report is diagnostic evidence; full strict runtime typing and
PSC0-SH/1 strict profile activation remain separate obligations.

### Review decisions before first execution

The child-provenance boundary also requires alpha-equality of the nested expected
result telescope and the whole worker result. This prevents a narrower induction
hypothesis from disguising missing state application. Fixtures include the rejection
and preservation of valid outer hypotheses. Session results are deeply immutable;
parsed cache limits are entry/source-text limits, not a hard compiler-heap bound.

### Setup checkpoint after first cloud attempt

Commit e67647ec4821d609188e6feb5a4de2380857767e started run37831018572.
Job113496067989 stopped in Lean Action configuration because the historical branch
had no lake-manifest.json; no semantic tests or compiler generation ran. Add the
correct dependency-free manifest and explicitly register Ps.Elab.Recursion in Lake.
Preserve the historical changed-argument refusal test by selecting BatchStable; the
enhanced path is covered by the generated raw-source capability corpus. Rerun the
same coherent qualification after these integration corrections.

### Native build checkpoint

Run37831457914 at e52c30313b1e9124864a304a41f3b4b4c8f74bd0 recovered and
cached S0 successfully (JavaScript SHA25674dcebb7b296d81924d92987e99146b5d1c5ff9fbe3d8076ca591952d2ef7f76).
The new recursion module, context and term changes compiled natively. The wrapper
used two Lean4.34 reserved words as local names (`meta` and `public`); rename them
to metaContext and publicDeclaration together. No semantic acceptance rule changed.
Candidate and full qualification remain pending; reuse the cached seed/build outputs.

### Development gate validation checkpoint

Run37831951758 at e91b9558d665879871b8bf0893915ae64b27c7fe has passed native
compilation and the generated C1 candidate, including raw capability and session
conformance. Current-source C2/C3 and subsequent provider decisions remain pending.
The implementation branch is held at that immutable revision while qualification runs.

A separate psc0/sh1-development-gate-v1 checkpoint adds host-only iteration/recovery
tooling for one bounded native-candidate validation. Portable compiler source remains
identical to e91b9558. No active selfhost-seed.json or Foundation source migration is
included. The temporary workflow branch filter and ref-scoped concurrency preserve
the running full qualification.

Ordinary pushes build the current native PSC frontend and use it to emit N1, then
execute raw capabilities, preparation sessions and a two-module resident CLI smoke.
This evidence is native-seeded development execution, not selected-seed ancestry or
a self-host fixed point. Full qualification retains selected-seed C1/C2/C3 and the
independent provider job. The frozen diagnostic ownership case shares the existing
session conformance boundary. Historical recovery verifies complete provenance and
all four seed products; a malformed cache reconstructs rather than becoming selected.

Once A is qualified, pin its actual source/toolchain/product identities, restore the
implementation workflow branch filter, and apply the staged Foundation.List migration
with its bounded behavior/public-type correspondence gate. Preserve A's historical
source recovery path before allowing B to use the new authoring capability.

### Bounded development result

Commit9641928bcf7d5394f46e19a31a8ae3fd096d44b5 passed run37834854232 on its
first execution. Job113509175107 took74seconds including a15second incremental
native build. The native-candidate receipt reports14590.443683milliseconds for
N1 generation and bounded capability/session/CLI checks. The raw closure has56
modules and SHA2567e18013c260de84b08d57e923aef184993b0c5fea4de4775a68288a8ff9e157a.
N1 JavaScript SHA2569d8a91e890c779c6b377b8a482ae3e997a1630b360eb8d6e7c022b3964510096.
These are single cached Linux x64 development measurements, not a fixed-point or
provider claim. The Foundation behavior matrix correctly skipped unchanged source.
See docs/selfhost-language/qualification-evidence.json for this durable checkpoint.

The next migration checkpoint is staged with additive dev:sh1/iterate:sh1 commands,
the same verified-seed Foundation comparison moved ahead of expensive C1 generation,
and a focused update of check-modular-preparation-source.mjs. That legacy guard
still assumed the old worker spelling and accidentally scanned two structures after
the new state type was added. Its replacement preserves prepared declarations-only
ownership and all unchanged admission/provider-session boundaries; generated session
correspondence already supplies the semantic evidence. Run it in B's early source
checks. Portable compiler source and selected seed remain at A until full evidence.
