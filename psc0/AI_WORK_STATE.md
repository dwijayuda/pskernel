# PSC0 SH/1 implementation work state

Updated: 2026-10-08 UTC.

## Active objective

Implement the accepted self-host authoring and iteration plan from research commit
80d04e7ab0e9214ffecf093a6272865f0eaca096. Start with ordinary structural recursion
that changes nondependent value parameters, a pure preparation seam, and focused
generated-compiler qualification. Migrate source families only after capability
evidence passes.

Execution branch: psc0/sh1-implementation-v1.
Historical compiler baseline: 37f63c39d4a07189938046c64152bba25d789450.
The historical 55-module record remains immutable.

## Boundaries

- GitHub/cloud only; no local checkout, builds or tests.
- Kernel/provider implementation and metatheory belong to the native workstream.
- No profile activation or checked/native success claim without corresponding evidence.
- Keep current public compiler APIs and source signatures compatible.
- Solve shared semantic/architectural causes; do not weaken gates to obtain a pass.
- Use focused validation for a complete implementation slice, then current-source
  C2/C3 qualification at the milestone.

## Current work

- Recursion: canonical stable/major worker plus function-valued generalized state;
  preserve public binder kinds and argument order with a wrapper. Reject unsupported
  dependent telescopes and escaping self references.
- Provenance: inspect and enforce which nested matches may introduce decreasing children.
- Preparation: pure start/parsed-step/source-step/finish with both environment and
  ordered declaration accumulator. Session caches retain a valid exact-source prefix
  within one compiler import.
- Qualification: pinned historical seed; isolated TypeScript5.8.3 installation;
  branch-scoped cloud workflow; raw .lean/.ps capability examples; candidate execution;
  explicit C2/C3 canonical source/admission/TS/JS equality.
- Native integration coordination: observed branch psc0/native-core-selfhost-v1 at
  963030dc2d154008fccc82e7c8ed29331f138799. Named native workflow run37825822957,
  job113478295740 completed its actual full checked compiler fixedpoint successfully.
  Source hash ee6dd22f1b74b97113cc1a5e36aadad3cceecb2b152653f2c0dc26dd07aa22f7;
  TypeScript hash fb173a348d1555d1ff224b9977f6fee68591b79f781a6b292c2572648415b033.
  This is evidence for the historical native baseline, not acceptance of our new worker
  admissions. New admissions will be checked through a separate pinned provider checkout.

## Design clarification

Canonical surface source is the output of the existing syntax translator. Lowered
worker/core structure is represented by canonical admissions. The minimum checkpoint
does not add a second elaboration-aware source printer. Generated compilers must
consume raw authored forms, so the new lowering path is exercised directly.

## Evidence and next checkpoint

The first coherent implementation checkpoint contains portable recursion lowering,
preparation/session reuse, raw capability fixtures, C2/C3 qualification, diagnostic IR
inventory and a separate pinned native-provider acceptance job. Its commit requests
[sh1-qualify]; compiler and provider outcomes are pending cloud execution. After earned capability
qualification, migrate a bounded Foundation.List family using a pinned qualified seed.
The independent host IR report is diagnostic evidence; full strict runtime typing and
PSC0-SH/1 strict profile activation remain separate obligations.

## Review decisions before first execution

The child-provenance boundary also requires alpha-equality of the nested expected
result telescope and the whole worker result. This prevents a narrower induction
hypothesis from disguising missing state application. Fixtures include the rejection
and preservation of valid outer hypotheses. Session results are deeply immutable;
parsed cache limits are entry/source-text limits, not a hard compiler-heap bound.

## Setup checkpoint after first cloud attempt

Commit e67647ec4821d609188e6feb5a4de2380857767e started run37831018572.
Job113496067989 stopped in Lean Action configuration because the historical branch
had no lake-manifest.json; no semantic tests or compiler generation ran. Add the
correct dependency-free manifest and explicitly register Ps.Elab.Recursion in Lake.
Preserve the historical changed-argument refusal test by selecting BatchStable; the
enhanced path is covered by the generated raw-source capability corpus. Rerun the
same coherent qualification after these integration corrections.

## Native build checkpoint

Run37831457914 at e52c30313b1e9124864a304a41f3b4b4c8f74bd0 recovered and
cached S0 successfully (JavaScript SHA25674dcebb7b296d81924d92987e99146b5d1c5ff9fbe3d8076ca591952d2ef7f76).
The new recursion module, context and term changes compiled natively. The wrapper
used two Lean4.34 reserved words as local names (`meta` and `public`); rename them
to metaContext and publicDeclaration together. No semantic acceptance rule changed.
Candidate and full qualification remain pending; reuse the cached seed/build outputs.

## Development gate validation checkpoint

Run37831951758 at e91b9558d665879871b8bf0893915ae64b27c7fe has passed native
compilation and the generated C1 candidate, including raw capability and session
conformance. Current-source C2/C3 and subsequent provider decisions remain pending.
The implementation branch is held at that immutable revision while qualification runs.

A separate psc0/sh1-development-gate-v1 checkpoint adds host-only iteration/recovery
tooling for one bounded native-candidate validation. Portable compiler source remains
identical to e91b9558. No active selfhost-seed.json or Foundation source migration is
included. The temporary workflow branch filter and ref-scoped concurrency preserve
the running full qualification.

Ordinary pushes build the current native PSC frontend and use it to emit N1, then
execute raw capabilities, preparation sessions and a two-module resident CLI smoke.
This evidence is native-seeded development execution, not selected-seed ancestry or
a self-host fixed point. Full qualification retains selected-seed C1/C2/C3 and the
independent provider job. The frozen diagnostic ownership case shares the existing
session conformance boundary. Historical recovery verifies complete provenance and
all four seed products; a malformed cache reconstructs rather than becoming selected.

Once A is qualified, pin its actual source/toolchain/product identities, restore the
implementation workflow branch filter, and apply the staged Foundation.List migration
with its bounded behavior/public-type correspondence gate. Preserve A's historical
source recovery path before allowing B to use the new authoring capability.

## Bounded development result

Commit9641928bcf7d5394f46e19a31a8ae3fd096d44b5 passed run37834854232 on its
first execution. Job113509175107 took74seconds including a15second incremental
native build. The native-candidate receipt reports14590.443683milliseconds for
N1 generation and bounded capability/session/CLI checks. The raw closure has56
modules and SHA2567e18013c260de84b08d57e923aef184993b0c5fea4de4775a68288a8ff9e157a.

These are single cached Linux x64 development measurements, not a fixed-point or
provider claim. The Foundation behavior matrix correctly skipped unchanged source.
See docs/selfhost-language/qualification-evidence.json for this durable checkpoint.

The next migration checkpoint is staged with additive dev:sh1/iterate:sh1 commands,
the same verified-seed Foundation comparison moved ahead of expensive C1 generation,
and a focused update of check-modular-preparation-source.mjs. That legacy guard
still assumed the old worker spelling and accidentally scanned two structures after
the new state type was added. Its replacement preserves prepared declarations-only
ownership and all unchanged admission/provider-session boundaries; generated session
correspondence already supplies the semantic evidence. Run it in B's early source
checks. Portable compiler source and selected seed remain at A until full evidence.
