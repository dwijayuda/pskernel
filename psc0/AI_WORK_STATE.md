# PSC0 SH/1 implementation work state

Updated: 2026-10-08 UTC.

## Active objective

Implement the accepted self-host authoring and iteration plan from research commit
80d04e7ab0e9214ffecf093a6272865f0eaca096. Start with ordinary structural recursion
that changes nondependent value parameters, a pure preparation seam, and focused
generated-compiler qualification. Migrate source families only after capability
evidence passes.

Execution branch: psc0/sh1-implementation-v1.
Historical compiler baseline: 37f63c39d4a07189938046c64152bba25d789450.
The historical 55-module record remains immutable.

## Boundaries

- GitHub/cloud only; no local checkout, builds or tests.
- Kernel/provider implementation and metatheory belong to the native workstream.
- No profile activation or checked/native success claim without corresponding evidence.
- Keep current public compiler APIs and source signatures compatible.
- Solve shared semantic/architectural causes; do not weaken gates to obtain a pass.
- Use focused validation for a complete implementation slice, then current-source
  C2/C3 qualification at the milestone.

## Current work

- Recursion: canonical stable/major worker plus function-valued generalized state;
  preserve public binder kinds and argument order with a wrapper. Reject unsupported
  dependent telescopes and escaping self references.
- Provenance: inspect and enforce which nested matches may introduce decreasing children.
- Preparation: pure start/parsed-step/source-step/finish with both environment and
  ordered declaration accumulator. Session caches retain a valid exact-source prefix
  within one compiler import.
- Qualification: pinned historical seed; isolated TypeScript5.8.3 installation;
  branch-scoped cloud workflow; raw .lean/.ps capability examples; candidate execution;
  explicit C2/C3 canonical source/admission/TS/JS equality.
- Native integration coordination: observed branch psc0/native-core-selfhost-v1 at
  963030dc2d154008fccc82e7c8ed29331f138799. Named native workflow run37825822957,
  job113478295740 completed its actual full checked compiler fixedpoint successfully.
  Source hash ee6dd22f1b74b97113cc1a5e36aadad3cceecb2b152653f2c0dc26dd07aa22f7;
  TypeScript hash fb173a348d1555d1ff224b9977f6fee68591b79f781a6b292c2572648415b033.
  This is evidence for the historical native baseline, not acceptance of our new worker
  admissions. New admissions will be checked through a separate pinned provider checkout.

## Design clarification

Canonical surface source is the output of the existing syntax translator. Lowered
worker/core structure is represented by canonical admissions. The minimum checkpoint
does not add a second elaboration-aware source printer. Generated compilers must
consume raw authored forms, so the new lowering path is exercised directly.

## Evidence and next checkpoint

The first coherent implementation checkpoint contains portable recursion lowering,
preparation/session reuse, raw capability fixtures, C2/C3 qualification, diagnostic IR
inventory and a separate pinned native-provider acceptance job. Its commit requests
[sh1-qualify]; compiler and provider outcomes are pending cloud execution. After earned capability
qualification, migrate a bounded Foundation.List family using a pinned qualified seed.
The independent host IR report is diagnostic evidence; full strict runtime typing and
PSC0-SH/1 strict profile activation remain separate obligations.

## Review decisions before first execution

The child-provenance boundary also requires alpha-equality of the nested expected
result telescope and the whole worker result. This prevents a narrower induction
hypothesis from disguising missing state application. Fixtures include the rejection
and preservation of valid outer hypotheses. Session results are deeply immutable;
parsed cache limits are entry/source-text limits, not a hard compiler-heap bound.

## Setup checkpoint after first cloud attempt

Commit e67647ec4821d609188e6feb5a4de2380857767e started run37831018572.
Job113496067989 stopped in Lean Action configuration because the historical branch
had no lake-manifest.json; no semantic tests or compiler generation ran. Add the
correct dependency-free manifest and explicitly register Ps.Elab.Recursion in Lake.
Preserve the historical changed-argument refusal test by selecting BatchStable; the
enhanced path is covered by the generated raw-source capability corpus. Rerun the
same coherent qualification after these integration corrections.
