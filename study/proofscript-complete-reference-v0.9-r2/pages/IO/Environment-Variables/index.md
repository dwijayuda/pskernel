# ProofScript — 21.7. Environment Variables

[Reference home](../../../README.md) · **Grammar:** `ps-0.9-r2` · **Semantic pin:** Lean 4.34.0 stable.

Native IO separates a logical description from execution in a runtime environment. Console operations, mutable references, files, processes, clocks, randomness and tasks have exact APIs and effects. A file handle is a resource with identity and lifetime, not an immutable DTO. Browser, Node and Wasm hosts require explicit adapters; the existence of a Lean API does not establish that every target can implement it.

**Compiler and coverage boundary.** Retain native Task behavior rather than renaming Promise. Resource cleanup, cancellation, process termination and foreign failures need exact declared models; no undocumented async/await keyword is introduced.

**Inherited detail and attribution.** The section below is adapted from the Apache-2.0 Lean reference mirrored at [IO/Environment-Variables/index.html](https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/blob/65369c75c7b63124f1ba7f2289e573181db281f0/study/lean4-language-reference/IO/Environment-Variables/index.html). Source Git blob: `98daeeee7872423603066ba3491ef2c4485192ca`. Its prose, API signatures and native names are retained where they describe the inherited semantics. Selected definition-keyword presentation aliases are recorded separately, not certified by a PSC parser. Native toolchains, intentional errors and historical releases keep their actual identities. The mirror contains rc2 material; the stable pin and stable-delta audit override conflicting claims.

## 21.7. Environment Variables

<a id="IO___getEnv"></a>

**opaque**

```text
IO.getEnv (var : String) : BaseIO (Option String)
```

Returns the value of the environment variable `var`, or `none` if it is not present in the environment.
