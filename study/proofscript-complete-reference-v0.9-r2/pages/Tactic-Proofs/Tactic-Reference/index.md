# ProofScript — 14.5. Tactic Reference

[Reference home](../../../README.md) · **Grammar:** `ps-0.9-r2` · **Semantic pin:** Lean 4.34.0 stable.

Tactics construct proof terms, and the checker decides whether those terms prove the requested claim. Use the inherited tactic language, including goal management, rewriting, induction and conv. Semicolon sequencing and the apply-to-all-goals combinator are distinct. Native grammar displays and tactic signatures below describe the selected environment, not a second ProofScript tactic system.

**Compiler and coverage boundary.** Term decorations may appear only in explicitly lifted tactic term slots. Preserve goal names, hygiene and source maps. Search failure is not proof of falsity.

**Inherited detail and attribution.** The section below is adapted from the Apache-2.0 Lean reference mirrored at [Tactic-Proofs/Tactic-Reference/index.html](https://github.com/dwijayuda/pskernel/blob/65369c75c7b63124f1ba7f2289e573181db281f0/study/lean4-language-reference/Tactic-Proofs/Tactic-Reference/index.html). Source Git blob: `b085cf3ee7ea00881d31c5b4051825ff71a15b86`. Its prose, API signatures and native names are retained where they describe the inherited semantics. Selected definition-keyword presentation aliases are recorded separately, not certified by a PSC parser. Native toolchains, intentional errors and historical releases keep their actual identities. The mirror contains rc2 material; the stable pin and stable-delta audit override conflicting claims.

## 14.5. Tactic Reference

<a id="tactic-ref-classical"></a>
### 14.5.1. Classical Logic

<a id="classical"></a>

**tactic**

```text
classical
```

`classical tacs` runs `tacs` in a scope where `Classical.propDecidable` is a low priority local instance.

Note that `classical` is a scoping tactic: it adds the instance only within the scope of the tactic.

<a id="tactic-ref-assumptions"></a>
### 14.5.2. Assumptions

<a id="assumption"></a>

**tactic**

```text
assumption
```

`assumption` tries to solve the main goal using a hypothesis of compatible type, or else fails. Note also the `‹t›` term notation, which is a shorthand for `show t by assumption`.

<a id="apply_assumption"></a>

**tactic**

```text
apply_assumption
```

`apply_assumption` looks for an assumption of the form `... → ∀ _, ... → head` where `head` matches the current goal.

You can specify additional rules to apply using `apply_assumption [...]`. By default `apply_assumption` will also try `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun`, and `congrArg`. If you don't want these, or don't want to use all hypotheses, use `apply_assumption only [...]`. You can use `apply_assumption [-h]` to omit a local hypothesis. You can use `apply_assumption using [a₁, ...]` to use all lemmas which have been labelled with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

`apply_assumption` will use consequences of local hypotheses obtained via `symm`.

If `apply_assumption` fails, it will call `exfalso` and try again. Thus if there is an assumption of the form `P → ¬ Q`, the new tactic state will have two goals, `P` and `Q`.

You can pass a further configuration via the syntax `apply_rules (config := {...}) lemmas`. The options supported are the same as for `solve_by_elim` (and include all the options for `apply`).

<a id="tactic-ref-quantifiers"></a>
### 14.5.3. Quantifiers

<a id="exists"></a>

**tactic**

```text
exists
```

`exists e₁, e₂, ...` is shorthand for `refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ...⟩; try trivial`. It is useful for existential goals.

<a id="intro"></a>

**tactic**

```text
intro
```

Introduces one or more hypotheses, optionally naming and/or pattern-matching them. For each hypothesis to be introduced, the remaining main goal's target type must be a `let` or function type.

- `intro` by itself introduces one anonymous hypothesis, which can be accessed by e.g. `assumption`. It is equivalent to `intro _`.
- `intro x y` introduces two hypotheses and names them. Individual hypotheses can be anonymized via `_`, given a type ascription, or matched against a pattern:

   

  ```proofscript
  intro (a, b)
  -- ..., a : α, b : β ⊢ ...
  ```
- `intro rfl` is short for `intro h; subst h`, if `h` is an equality where the left-hand or right-hand side is a variable.
- Alternatively, `intro` can be combined with pattern matching much like `fun`:

   

  ```text
  intro
  | n + 1, 0 => tac
  | ...
  ```

<a id="intros"></a>

**tactic**

```text
intros
```

`intros` repeatedly applies `intro` to introduce zero or more hypotheses until the goal is no longer a *binding expression* (i.e., a universal quantifier, function type, implication, or `have`/`let`), without performing any definitional reductions (no unfolding, beta, eta, etc.). The introduced hypotheses receive inaccessible (hygienic) names.

`intros x y z` is equivalent to `intro x y z` and exists only for historical reasons. The `intro` tactic should be preferred in this case.

**Properties and relations**

- `intros` succeeds even when it introduces no hypotheses.
- `repeat intro` is like `intros`, but it performs definitional reductions to expose binders, and as such it may introduce more hypotheses than `intros`.
- `intros` is equivalent to `intro _ _ … _`, with the fewest trailing `_` placeholders needed so that the goal is no longer a binding expression. The trailing introductions do not perform any definitional reductions.

**Examples**

Implications:

```proofscript
example (p q : Prop) : p → q → p := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     a✝¹ : p
     a✝ : q
     ⊢ p      -/
  assumption
```

Let-bindings:

```proofscript
example : let n := 1; let k := 2; n + k = 3 := by
  intros
  /- n✝ : Nat := 1
     k✝ : Nat := 2
     ⊢ n✝ + k✝ = 3 -/
  rfl
```

Does not unfold definitions:

<!-- Presentation aliases only; canonical source retained in the edit ledger. -->

```proofscript
function AllEven (f : Nat → Nat) := ∀ n, f n % 2 = 0

example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     f✝ : Nat → Nat
     a✝ : AllEven f✝
     ⊢ AllEven fun k => f✝ (k + 1) -/
  sorry
```

<a id="rintro"></a>

**tactic**

```text
rintro
```

The `rintro` tactic is a combination of the `intros` tactic with `rcases` to allow for destructuring patterns while introducing variables. See `rcases` for a description of supported patterns. For example, `rintro (a | ⟨b, c⟩) ⟨d, e⟩` will introduce two variables, and then do case splits on both of them producing two subgoals, one with variables `a d e` and the other with `b c d e`.

`rintro`, unlike `rcases`, also supports the form `(x y : ty)` for introducing and type-ascripting multiple variables at once, similar to binders.

<a id="tactic-ref-relations"></a>
### 14.5.4. Relations

<a id="rfl"></a>

**tactic**

```text
rfl
```

This tactic applies to a goal whose target has the form `x ~ x`, where `~` is equality, heterogeneous equality or any relation that has a reflexivity lemma tagged with the attribute @[refl].

<a id="rfl___"></a>

**tactic**

```text
rfl'
```

`rfl'` is similar to `rfl`, but disables smart unfolding and unfolds all kinds of definitions, theorems included (relevant for declarations defined by well-founded recursion).

<a id="apply_rfl"></a>

**tactic**

```text
apply_rfl
```

The same as `rfl`, but without trying `eq_refl` at the end.

<a id="attr-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next"></a>

**attribute**

**Reflexive Relations**

The `refl` attribute marks a lemma as a proof of reflexivity for some relation. These lemmas are used by the `rfl`, `rfl'`, and `apply_rfl` tactics.

<a id="Lean___Parser___Attr___simple-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next"></a>

```ebnf
attr ::= ...
    | refl
```

<a id="symm"></a>

**tactic**

```text
symm
```

- `symm` applies to a goal whose target has the form `t ~ u` where `~` is a symmetric relation, that is, a relation which has a symmetry lemma tagged with the attribute [symm]. It replaces the target with `u ~ t`.
- `symm at h` will rewrite a hypothesis `h : t ~ u` to `h : u ~ t`.

<a id="symm_saturate"></a>

**tactic**

```text
symm_saturate
```

For every hypothesis `h : a ~ b` where a `@[symm]` lemma is available, add a hypothesis `h_symm : b ~ a`.

<a id="attr-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next"></a>

**attribute**

**Symmetric Relations**

The `symm` attribute marks a lemma as a proof that a relation is symmetric. These lemmas are used by the `symm` and `symm_saturate` tactics.

<a id="Lean___Parser___Attr___simple-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next-next"></a>

```ebnf
attr ::= ...
    | symm
```

<a id="calc"></a>

**tactic**

```text
calc
```

Step-wise reasoning over transitive relations.

```text
calc
  a = b := pab
  b = c := pbc
  ...
  y = z := pyz
```

proves `a = z` from the given step-wise proofs. `=` can be replaced with any relation implementing the typeclass `Trans`. Instead of repeating the right- hand sides, subsequent left-hand sides can be replaced with `_`.

```text
calc
  a = b := pab
  _ = c := pbc
  ...
  _ = z := pyz
```

It is also possible to write the *first* relation as `<lhs>\n  _ = <rhs> := <proof>`. This is useful for aligning relation symbols, especially on longer identifiers:

```text
calc abc
  _ = bce := pabce
  _ = cef := pbcef
  ...
  _ = xyz := pwxyz
```

`calc` works as a term, as a tactic or as a `conv` tactic.

See [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/quantifiers_and_equality.html#calculational-proofs) for more information.

<a id="Trans___mk"></a>

**type class**

```text
Trans.{u, v, w, u_1, u_2, u_3} {α : Sort u_1} {β : Sort u_2}
  {γ : Sort u_3} (r : α → β → Sort u) (s : β → γ → Sort v)
  (t : outParam (α → γ → Sort w)) :
  Sort (max (max (max (max (max (max 1 u) u_1) u_2) u_3) v) w)
```

Transitive chaining of proofs, used e.g. by `calc`.

It takes two relations `r` and `s` as "input", and produces an "output" relation `t`, with the property that `r a b` and `s b c` implies `t a c`. The `calc` tactic uses this so that when it sees a chain with `a ≤ b` and `b < c` it knows that this should be a proof of `a < c` because there is an instance `Trans (·≤·) (·<·) (·<·)`.

**Instance Constructor**

```text
Trans.mk.{u, v, w, u_1, u_2, u_3}
```

**Methods**

```text
trans : {a : α} → {b : β} → {c : γ} → r a b → s b c → t a c
```

Compose two proofs by transitivity, generalized over the relations involved.

<a id="tactic-ref-equality"></a>
#### 14.5.4.1. Equality

<a id="subst"></a>

**tactic**

```text
subst
```

`subst x...` substitutes each hypothesis `x` with a definition found in the local context, then eliminates the hypothesis.

- If `x` is a local definition, then its definition is used.
- Otherwise, if there is a hypothesis of the form `x = e` or `e = x`, then `e` is used for the definition of `x`.

If `h : a = b`, then `subst h` may be used if either `a` or `b` unfolds to a local hypothesis. This is similar to the `cases h` tactic.

See also: `subst_vars` for substituting all local hypotheses that have a defining equation.

<a id="subst_eqs"></a>

**tactic**

```text
subst_eqs
```

`subst_eq` repeatedly substitutes according to the equality proof hypotheses in the context, replacing the left side of the equality with the right, until no more progress can be made.

<a id="subst_vars"></a>

**tactic**

```text
subst_vars
```

Applies `subst` to all hypotheses of the form `h : x = t` or `h : t = x`.

<a id="congr"></a>

**tactic**

```text
congr
```

Apply congruence (recursively) to goals of the form `⊢ f as = f bs` and `⊢ f as ≍ f bs`. The optional parameter is the depth of the recursive applications. This is useful when `congr` is too aggressive in breaking down the goal. For example, given `⊢ f (g (x + y)) = f (g (y + x))`, `congr` produces the goals `⊢ x = y` and `⊢ y = x`, while `congr 2` produces the intended `⊢ x + y = y + x`.

<a id="eq_refl"></a>

**tactic**

```text
eq_refl
```

`eq_refl` is equivalent to `exact rfl`, but has a few optimizations.

<a id="ac_rfl"></a>

**tactic**

```text
ac_rfl
```

`ac_rfl` proves equalities up to application of an associative and commutative operator.

```proofscript
instance : Std.Associative (α := Nat) (.+.) := ⟨Nat.add_assoc⟩
instance : Std.Commutative (α := Nat) (.+.) := ⟨Nat.add_comm⟩

example (a b c d : Nat) : a + b + c + d = d + (b + c) + a := by ac_rfl
```

<a id="tactic-ref-associativity-commutativity"></a>
### 14.5.5. Associativity and Commutativity

<a id="ac_nf"></a>

**tactic**

```text
ac_nf
```

`ac_nf` normalizes equalities up to application of an associative and commutative operator.

- `ac_nf` normalizes all hypotheses and the goal target of the goal.
- `ac_nf at l` normalizes at location(s) `l`, where `l` is either `*` or a list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter case, a turnstile `⊢` or `|-` can also be used, to signify the target of the goal.

```proofscript
instance : Std.Associative (α := Nat) (.+.) := ⟨Nat.add_assoc⟩
instance : Std.Commutative (α := Nat) (.+.) := ⟨Nat.add_comm⟩

example (a b c d : Nat) : a + b + c + d = d + (b + c) + a := by
 ac_nf
 -- goal: a + (b + (c + d)) = a + (b + (c + d))
```

<a id="ac_nf0"></a>

**tactic**

```text
ac_nf0
```

Implementation of `ac_nf` (the full `ac_nf` calls `trivial` afterwards).

<a id="tactic-ref-lemmas"></a>
### 14.5.6. Lemmas

<a id="exact"></a>

**tactic**

```text
exact
```

`exact e` closes the main goal if its target type matches that of `e`.

<a id="apply"></a>

**tactic**

```text
apply
```

`apply e` tries to match the current goal against the conclusion of `e`'s type. If it succeeds, then the tactic returns as many subgoals as the number of premises that have not been fixed by type inference or type class resolution. Non-dependent premises are added before dependent ones.

The `apply` tactic uses higher-order pattern matching, type class resolution, and first-order unification with dependent types.

<a id="refine"></a>

**tactic**

```text
refine
```

`refine e` behaves like `exact e`, except that named (`?x`) or unnamed (`?_`) holes in `e` that are not solved by unification with the main goal's target type are converted into new goals, using the hole's name, if any, as the goal case name.

<a id="refine___"></a>

**tactic**

```text
refine'
```

`refine' e` behaves like `refine e`, except that unsolved placeholders (`_`) and implicit parameters are also converted into new goals.

<a id="solve_by_elim"></a>

**tactic**

```text
solve_by_elim
```

`solve_by_elim` calls `apply` on the main goal to find an assumption whose head matches and then repeatedly calls `apply` on the generated subgoals until no subgoals remain, performing at most `maxDepth` (defaults to 6) recursive steps.

`solve_by_elim` discharges the current goal or fails.

`solve_by_elim` performs backtracking if subgoals can not be solved.

By default, the assumptions passed to `apply` are the local context, `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun` and `congrArg`.

The assumptions can be modified with similar syntax as for `simp`:

- `solve_by_elim [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` also applies the given expressions.
- `solve_by_elim only [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` does not include the local context, `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun`, or `congrArg` unless they are explicitly included.
- `solve_by_elim [-h₁, ... -hₙ]` removes the given local hypotheses.
- `solve_by_elim using [a₁, ...]` uses all lemmas which have been labelled with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

`solve_by_elim*` tries to solve all goals together, using backtracking if a solution for one goal makes other goals impossible. (Adding or removing local hypotheses may not be well-behaved when starting with multiple goals.)

Optional arguments passed via a configuration argument as `solve_by_elim (config := { ... })`

- `maxDepth`: number of attempts at discharging generated subgoals
- `symm`: adds all hypotheses derived by `symm` (defaults to `true`).
- `exfalso`: allow calling `exfalso` and trying again if `solve_by_elim` fails (defaults to `true`).
- `transparency`: change the transparency mode when calling `apply`. Defaults to `.default`, but it is often useful to change to `.reducible`, so semireducible definitions will not be unfolded when trying to apply a lemma.

See also the doc-comment for `Lean.Meta.Tactic.Backtrack.BacktrackConfig` for the options `proc`, `suspend`, and `discharge` which allow further customization of `solve_by_elim`. Both `apply_assumption` and `apply_rules` are implemented via these hooks.

<a id="apply_rules"></a>

**tactic**

```text
apply_rules
```

`apply_rules [l₁, l₂, ...]` tries to solve the main goal by iteratively applying the list of lemmas `[l₁, l₂, ...]` or by applying a local hypothesis. If `apply` generates new goals, `apply_rules` iteratively tries to solve those goals. You can use `apply_rules [-h]` to omit a local hypothesis.

`apply_rules` will also use `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun` and `congrArg`. These can be disabled, as can local hypotheses, by using `apply_rules only [...]`.

You can use `apply_rules using [a₁, ...]` to use all lemmas which have been labelled with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

You can pass a further configuration via the syntax `apply_rules (config := {...})`. The options supported are the same as for `solve_by_elim` (and include all the options for `apply`).

`apply_rules` will try calling `symm` on hypotheses and `exfalso` on the goal as needed. This can be disabled with `apply_rules (config := {symm := false, exfalso := false})`.

You can bound the iteration depth using the syntax `apply_rules (config := {maxDepth := n})`.

Unlike `solve_by_elim`, `apply_rules` does not perform backtracking, and greedily applies a lemma from the list until it gets stuck.

<a id="as_aux_lemma"></a>

**tactic**

```text
as_aux_lemma
```

`as_aux_lemma => tac` does the same as `tac`, except that it wraps the resulting expression into an auxiliary lemma. In some cases, this significantly reduces the size of expressions because the proof term is not duplicated.

<a id="tactic-ref-false"></a>
### 14.5.7. Falsehood

<a id="exfalso"></a>

**tactic**

```text
exfalso
```

`exfalso` converts a goal `⊢ tgt` into `⊢ False` by applying `False.elim`.

<a id="contradiction"></a>

**tactic**

```text
contradiction
```

`contradiction` closes the main goal if its hypotheses are "trivially contradictory".

- Inductive type/family with no applicable constructors

   

  ```proofscript
  example (h : False) : p := by contradiction
  ```
- Injectivity of constructors

   

  ```proofscript
  example (h : none = some true) : p := by contradiction  --
  ```
- Decidable false proposition

   

  ```proofscript
  example (h : 2 + 2 = 3) : p := by contradiction
  ```
- Contradictory hypotheses

   

  ```proofscript
  example (h : p) (h' : ¬ p) : q := by contradiction
  ```
- Other simple contradictions such as

   

  ```proofscript
  example (x : Nat) (h : x ≠ x) : p := by contradiction
  ```

<a id="false_or_by_contra"></a>

**tactic**

```text
false_or_by_contra
```

Changes the goal to `False`, retaining as much information as possible:

- If the goal is `False`, do nothing.
- If the goal is an implication or a function type, introduce the argument and restart. (In particular, if the goal is `x ≠ y`, introduce `x = y`.)
- Otherwise, for a propositional goal `P`, replace it with `¬ ¬ P` (attempting to find a `Decidable` instance, but otherwise falling back to working classically) and introduce `¬ P`.
- For a non-propositional goal use `False.elim`.

<a id="tactic-ref-goals"></a>
### 14.5.8. Goal Management

<a id="suffices"></a>

**tactic**

```text
suffices
```

Given a main goal `ctx ⊢ t`, `suffices h : t' from e` replaces the main goal with `ctx ⊢ t'`, `e` must have type `t` in the context `ctx, h : t'`.

The variant `suffices h : t' by tac` is a shorthand for `suffices h : t' from by tac`. If `h :` is omitted, the name `this` is used.

<a id="change"></a>

**tactic**

```text
change
```

- `change tgt'` will change the goal from `tgt` to `tgt'`, assuming these are definitionally equal.
- `change t' at h` will change hypothesis `h : t` to have type `t'`, assuming assuming `t` and `t'` are definitionally equal.
- `change a with b` will change occurrences of `a` to `b` in the goal, assuming `a` and `b` are definitionally equal.
- `change a with b at h` similarly changes `a` to `b` in the type of hypothesis `h`.

<a id="generalize"></a>

**tactic**

```text
generalize
```

- `generalize ([h :] e = x),+` replaces all occurrences `e`s in the main goal with a fresh hypothesis `x`s. If `h` is given, `h : e = x` is introduced as well.
- `generalize e = x at h₁ ... hₙ` also generalizes occurrences of `e` inside `h₁`, ..., `hₙ`.
- `generalize e = x at *` will generalize occurrences of `e` everywhere.

<a id="specialize"></a>

**tactic**

```text
specialize
```

`specialize h a₁ ... aₙ` is equivalent to `replace h := h a₁ ... aₙ`. It specializes the local hypothesis `h` by instantiating universal quantifications and implications using the concrete terms `a₁` ... `aₙ`. The tactic adds a new hypothesis with the same name and tries to remove the original `h` if possible.

Example: given `h : ∀ (n : Nat), p n → q n` and `h' : p 2`, then `specialize h 2 h'` replaces `h` with `h : q 2`.

The tactic also supports instantiating particular universal quantifiers using named argument syntax. Example: given `h : ∀ (m n : Nat), p m n`, then `specialize h (n := 2)` replaces `h` with `h : ∀ (m : Nat), p m 2`.

<a id="obtain"></a>

**tactic**

```text
obtain
```

The `obtain` tactic is a combination of `have` and `rcases`. See `rcases` for a description of supported patterns.

```text
obtain ⟨patt⟩ : type := proof
```

is equivalent to

```text
have h : type := proof
rcases h with ⟨patt⟩
```

If `⟨patt⟩` is omitted, `rcases` will try to infer the pattern.

If `type` is omitted, `:= proof` is required.

<a id="show"></a>

**tactic**

```text
show
```

`show t` finds the first goal whose target unifies with `t`. It makes that the main goal, performs the unification, and replaces the target with the unified version of `t`.

<a id="show_term"></a>

**tactic**

```text
show_term
```

`show_term tac` runs `tac`, then prints the generated term in the form "exact X Y Z" or "refine X ?_ Z" (prefixed by `expose_names` if necessary) if there are remaining subgoals.

(For some tactics, the printed term will not be human readable.)

<a id="tactic-ref-casts"></a>
### 14.5.9. Cast Management

The tactics in this section make it easier avoid getting stuck on 
<a id="--tech-term-casts"></a>
*casts*, which are functions that coerce data from one type to another, such as converting a natural number to the corresponding integer. They are described in more detail by Lewis and Madelaine (2020)Robert Y. Lewis and Paul-Nicolas Madelaine, 2020. [“Simplifying Casts and Coercions”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10594). arXiv:2001.10594.

<a id="norm_cast"></a>

**tactic**

```text
norm_cast
```

The `norm_cast` family of tactics is used to normalize certain coercions (*casts*) in expressions.

- `norm_cast` normalizes casts in the target.
- `norm_cast at h` normalizes casts in hypothesis `h`.

The tactic is basically a version of `simp` with a specific set of lemmas to move casts upwards in the expression. Therefore even in situations where non-terminal `simp` calls are discouraged (because of fragility), `norm_cast` is considered to be safe. It also has special handling of numerals.

For instance, given an assumption

```text
a b : ℤ
h : ↑a + ↑b < (10 : ℚ)
```

writing `norm_cast at h` will turn `h` into

```text
h : a + b < 10
```

There are also variants of basic tactics that use `norm_cast` to normalize expressions during their operation, to make them more flexible about the expressions they accept (we say that it is a tactic *modulo* the effects of `norm_cast`):

- `exact_mod_cast` for `exact` and `apply_mod_cast` for `apply`. Writing `exact_mod_cast h` and `apply_mod_cast h` will normalize casts in the goal and `h` before using `exact h` or `apply h`.
- `rw_mod_cast` for `rw`. It applies `norm_cast` between rewrites.
- `assumption_mod_cast` for `assumption`. This is effectively `norm_cast at *; assumption`, but more efficient. It normalizes casts in the goal and, for every hypothesis `h` in the context, it will try to normalize casts in `h` and use `exact h`.

See also `push_cast`, which moves casts inwards rather than lifting them outwards.

<a id="push_cast"></a>

**tactic**

```text
push_cast
```

`push_cast` rewrites the goal to move certain coercions (*casts*) inward, toward the leaf nodes. This uses `norm_cast` lemmas in the forward direction. For example, `↑(a + b)` will be written to `↑a + ↑b`.

- `push_cast` moves casts inward in the goal.
- `push_cast at h` moves casts inward in the hypothesis `h`. It can be used with extra simp lemmas with, for example, `push_cast [Int.add_zero]`.

Example:

```proofscript
example (a b : Nat)
    (h1 : ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10)
    (h2 : ((a + b + 0 : Nat) : Int) = 10) :
    ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10 := by
  /-
  h1 : ↑(a + b) = 10
  h2 : ↑(a + b + 0) = 10
  ⊢ ↑(a + b) = 10
  -/

  /- Now
  ⊢ ↑a + ↑b = 10

```

See also `norm_cast`.

<a id="exact_mod_cast"></a>

**tactic**

Normalize casts in the goal and the given expression, then close the goal with `exact`.

<a id="apply_mod_cast"></a>

**tactic**

```text

Normalize casts in the goal and the given expression, then `apply` the expression to the goal.

<a id="rw_mod_cast"></a>

<a id="assumption_mod_cast"></a>

**tactic**

```text
assumption_mod_cast
```

`assumption_mod_cast` is a variant of `assumption` that solves the goal using a hypothesis. Unlike `assumption`, it first pre-processes the goal and each hypothesis to move casts as far outwards as possible, so it can be used in more situations.

Concretely, it runs `norm_cast` on the goal. For each local hypothesis `h`, it also normalizes `h` with `norm_cast` and tries to use that to close the goal.

### 14.5.10. Managing let Expressions

<a id="extract_lets"></a>

**tactic**

```text
extract_lets
```

Extracts `let` and `have` expressions from within the target or a local hypothesis, introducing new local definitions.

- `extract_lets` extracts all the lets from the target.
- `extract_lets x y z` extracts all the lets from the target and uses `x`, `y`, and `z` for the first names. Using `_` for a name leaves it unnamed.
- `extract_lets x y z at h` operates on the local hypothesis `h` instead of the target.

For example, given a local hypotheses if the form `h : let x := v; b x`, then `extract_lets z at h` introduces a new local definition `z := v` and changes `h` to be `h : b z`.

<a id="lift_lets"></a>

**tactic**

```text
lift_lets
```

Lifts `let` and `have` expressions within a term as far out as possible. It is like `extract_lets +lift`, but the top-level lets at the end of the procedure are not extracted as local hypotheses.

- `lift_lets` lifts let expressions in the target.
- `lift_lets at h` lifts let expressions at the given local hypothesis.

For example,

```text
example : (let x := 1; x) = 1 := by
  lift_lets
  -- ⊢ let x := 1; x = 1
  ...
```

<a id="let_to_have"></a>

**tactic**

```text
let_to_have
```

Transforms `let` expressions into `have` expressions when possible.

- `let_to_have` transforms `let`s in the target.
- `let_to_have at h` transforms `let`s in the given local hypothesis.

<a id="clear_value"></a>

**tactic**

```text
clear_value
```

- `clear_value x...` clears the values of the given local definitions. A local definition `x : α := v` becomes a hypothesis `x : α`.
- `clear_value (h : x = _)` adds a hypothesis `h : x = v` before clearing the value of `x`. This is short for `have h : x = v := rfl; clear_value x`. Any value definitionally equal to `v` can be used in place of `_`.
- `clear_value *` clears values of all hypotheses that can be cleared. Fails if none can be cleared.

These syntaxes can be combined. For example, `clear_value x y *` ensures that `x` and `y` are cleared while trying to clear all other local definitions, and `clear_value (hx : x = _) y * with hx` does the same while first adding the `hx : x = v` hypothesis.

<a id="tactic-ref-ext"></a>
### 14.5.11. Extensionality

<a id="ext"></a>

**tactic**

```text
ext
```

Applies extensionality lemmas that are registered with the `@[ext]` attribute.

- `ext pat*` applies extensionality theorems as much as possible, using the patterns `pat*` to introduce the variables in extensionality theorems using `rintro`. For example, the patterns are used to name the variables introduced by lemmas such as `funext`.
- Without patterns,`ext` applies extensionality lemmas as much as possible but introduces anonymous hypotheses whenever needed.
- `ext pat* : n` applies ext theorems only up to depth `n`.

The `ext1 pat*` tactic is like `ext pat*` except that it only applies a single extensionality theorem.

Unused patterns will generate warning. Patterns that don't match the variables will typically result in the introduction of anonymous hypotheses.

<a id="ext1"></a>

**tactic**

```text
ext1
```

`ext1 pat*` is like `ext pat*` except that it only applies a single extensionality theorem rather than recursively applying as many extensionality theorems as possible.

The `pat*` patterns are processed using the `rintro` tactic. If no patterns are supplied, then variables are introduced anonymously using the `intros` tactic.

<a id="apply_ext_theorem"></a>

**tactic**

```text
apply_ext_theorem
```

Apply a single extensionality theorem to the current goal.

<a id="funext-next"></a>

**tactic**

```text
funext
```

Apply function extensionality and introduce new hypotheses. The tactic `funext` will keep applying the `funext` lemma until the goal target is not reducible to

```text
  |-  ((fun x => ...) = (fun x => ...))
```

The variant `funext h₁ ... hₙ` applies `funext` `n` times, and uses the given identifiers to name the new hypotheses. Patterns can be used like in the `intro` tactic. Example, given a goal

```text
  |-  ((fun x : Nat × Bool => ...) = (fun x => ...))
```

`funext (a, b)` applies `funext` once and performs pattern matching on the newly introduced pair.

### 14.5.12. SMT-Inspired Automation

<a id="grind"></a>

**tactic**

```text
grind
```

`grind` is a tactic inspired by modern SMT solvers. **Picture a virtual whiteboard**: every time grind discovers a new equality, inequality, or logical fact, it writes it on the board, groups together terms known to be equal, and lets each reasoning engine read from and contribute to the shared workspace. These engines work together to handle equality reasoning, apply known theorems, propagate new facts, perform case analysis, and run specialized solvers for domains like linear arithmetic and commutative rings.

See [the reference manual's chapter on `grind`](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/4.34.0-rc2/find/?domain=Verso.Genre.Manual.section&name=grind-tactic) for more information.

`grind` is *not* designed for goals whose search space explodes combinatorially, think large pigeonhole instances, graph‑coloring reductions, high‑order N‑queens boards, or a 200‑variable Sudoku encoded as Boolean constraints. Such encodings require thousands (or millions) of case‑splits that overwhelm `grind`’s branching search.

For **bit‑level or combinatorial problems**, consider using **`bv_decide`**. `bv_decide` calls a state‑of‑the‑art SAT solver (CaDiCaL) and then returns a *compact, machine‑checkable certificate*.

**Equality reasoning**

`grind` uses **congruence closure** to track equalities between terms. When two terms are known to be equal, congruence closure automatically deduces equalities between more complex expressions built from them. For example, if `a = b`, then congruence closure will also conclude that `f a` = `f b` for any function `f`. This forms the foundation for efficient equality reasoning in `grind`. Here is an example:

```proofscript
example (f : Nat → Nat) (h : a = b) : f (f b) = f (f a) := by
  grind
```

**Applying theorems using E-matching**

To apply existing theorems, `grind` uses a technique called **E-matching**, which finds matches for known theorem patterns while taking equalities into account. Combined with congruence closure, E-matching helps `grind` discover non-obvious consequences of theorems and equalities automatically.

Consider the following functions and theorems:

<!-- Presentation aliases only; canonical source retained in the edit ledger. -->

```proofscript
function f (a : Nat) : Nat :=
  a + 1

function g (a : Nat) : Nat :=
  a - 1

@[grind =]
theorem gf (x : Nat) : g (f x) = x := by
  simp [f, g]
```

The theorem `gf` asserts that `g (f x) = x` for all natural numbers `x`. The attribute `[grind =]` instructs `grind` to use the left-hand side of the equation, `g (f x)`, as a pattern for E-matching. Suppose we now have a goal involving:

```text
example {a b} (h : f b = a) : g a = b := by
  grind
```

Although `g a` is not an instance of the pattern `g (f x)`, it becomes one modulo the equation `f b = a`. By substituting `a` with `f b` in `g a`, we obtain the term `g (f b)`, which matches the pattern `g (f x)` with the assignment `x := b`. Thus, the theorem `gf` is instantiated with `x := b`, and the new equality `g (f b) = b` is asserted. `grind` then uses congruence closure to derive the implied equality `g a = g (f b)` and completes the proof.

The pattern used to instantiate theorems affects the effectiveness of `grind`. For example, the pattern `g (f x)` is too restrictive in the following case: the theorem `gf` will not be instantiated because the goal does not even contain the function symbol `g`.

```text
example (h₁ : f b = a) (h₂ : f c = a) : b = c := by
  grind
```

You can use the command `grind_pattern` to manually select a pattern for a given theorem. In the following example, we instruct `grind` to use `f x` as the pattern, allowing it to solve the goal automatically:

```text
grind_pattern gf => f x

example {a b c} (h₁ : f b = a) (h₂ : f c = a) : b = c := by
  grind
```

You can enable the option `trace.grind.ematch.instance` to make `grind` print a trace message for each theorem instance it generates.

You can also specify a **multi-pattern** to control when `grind` should apply a theorem. A multi-pattern requires that all specified patterns are matched in the current context before the theorem is applied. This is useful for theorems such as transitivity rules, where multiple premises must be simultaneously present for the rule to apply. The following example demonstrates this feature using a transitivity axiom for a binary relation `R`:

```proofscript
opaque R : Int → Int → Prop
axiom Rtrans {x y z : Int} : R x y → R y z → R x z

grind_pattern Rtrans => R x y, R y z

example {a b c d} : R a b → R b c → R c d → R a d := by
  grind
```

By specifying the multi-pattern `R x y, R y z`, we instruct `grind` to instantiate `Rtrans` only when both `R x y` and `R y z` are available in the context. In the example, `grind` applies `Rtrans` to derive `R a c` from `R a b` and `R b c`, and can then repeat the same reasoning to deduce `R a d` from `R a c` and `R c d`.

Instead of using `grind_pattern` to explicitly specify a pattern, you can use the `@[grind]` attribute or one of its variants, which will use a heuristic to generate a (multi-)pattern. The complete list is available in the reference manual. The main ones are:

- `@[grind →]` will select a multi-pattern from the hypotheses of the theorem (i.e. it will use the theorem for forwards reasoning). In more detail, it will traverse the hypotheses of the theorem from left-to-right, and each time it encounters a minimal indexable (i.e. has a constant as its head) subexpression which "covers" (i.e. fixes the value of) an argument which was not previously covered, it will add that subexpression as a pattern, until all arguments have been covered.
- `@[grind ←]` will select a multi-pattern from the conclusion of theorem (i.e. it will use the theorem for backwards reasoning). This may fail if not all the arguments to the theorem appear in the conclusion.
- `@[grind]` will traverse the conclusion and then the hypotheses left-to-right, adding patterns as they increase the coverage, stopping when all arguments are covered.
- `@[grind =]` checks that the conclusion of the theorem is an equality, and then uses the left-hand-side of the equality as a pattern. This may fail if not all of the arguments appear in the left-hand-side.

Here is the previous example again but using the attribute `[grind →]`

```proofscript
opaque R : Int → Int → Prop
@[grind →] axiom Rtrans {x y z : Int} : R x y → R y z → R x z

example {a b c d} : R a b → R b c → R c d → R a d := by
  grind
```

To control theorem instantiation and avoid generating an unbounded number of instances, `grind` uses a generation counter. Terms in the original goal are assigned generation zero. When `grind` applies a theorem using terms of generation `≤ n`, any new terms it creates are assigned generation `n + 1`. This limits how far the tactic explores when applying theorems and helps prevent an excessive number of instantiations.

**Key options:**

- `grind (ematch := <num>)` controls the number of E-matching rounds.
- `grind [<name>, ...]` instructs `grind` to use the declaration `name` during E-matching.
- `grind only [<name>, ...]` is like `grind [<name>, ...]` but does not use theorems tagged with `@[grind]`.
- `grind (gen := <num>)` sets the maximum generation.

**Linear integer arithmetic (`lia`)**

`grind` can solve goals that reduce to **linear integer arithmetic (LIA)** using an integrated decision procedure called **`lia`**. It understands

- equalities `p = 0`
- inequalities `p ≤ 0`
- disequalities `p ≠ 0`
- divisibility `d ∣ p`

The solver incrementally assigns integer values to variables; when a partial assignment violates a constraint it adds a new, implied constraint and retries. This *model-based* search is **complete for LIA**.

**Key options:**

- `grind -lia` disable the solver (useful for debugging)
- `grind +qlia` accept rational models (shrinks the search space but is incomplete for ℤ)
- `grind (liaSteps := n)` cap the number of steps performed by the model search (the solver becomes incomplete when the threshold is reached)

**Examples:**

```proofscript
example {x y : Int} : 2 * x + 4 * y ≠ 5 := by
  grind

-- Mixing equalities and inequalities.
example {x y : Int} :
    2 * x + 3 * y = 0 → 1 ≤ x → y < 1 := by
  grind

-- Reasoning with divisibility.
example (a b : Int) :
    2 ∣ a + 1 → 2 ∣ b + a → ¬ 2 ∣ b + 2 * a := by
  grind

example (x y : Int) :
    27 ≤ 11*x + 13*y →
    11*x + 13*y ≤ 45 →
    -10 ≤ 7*x - 9*y →
    7*x - 9*y ≤ 4 → False := by
  grind

-- Types that implement the `ToInt` type-class.
example (a b c : UInt64)
    : a ≤ 2 → b ≤ 3 → c - a - b = 0 → c ≤ 5 := by
  grind
```

**Algebraic solver (`ring`)**

`grind` ships with an algebraic solver nick-named **`ring`** for goals that can be phrased as polynomial equations (or disequations) over commutative rings, semirings, or fields.

*Works out of the box* All core numeric types and relevant Mathlib types already provide the required type-class instances, so the solver is ready to use in most developments.

What it can decide:

- equalities of the form `p = q`
- disequalities `p ≠ q`
- basic reasoning under field inverses (`a / b := a * b⁻¹`)
- goals that mix ring facts with other `grind` engines

**Key options:**

- `grind -ring` turn the solver off (useful when debugging)
- `grind (ringSteps := n)` cap the number of steps performed by this procedure.

**Examples**

```proofscript
open Lean Grind

example [CommRing α] (x : α) : (x + 1) * (x - 1) = x^2 - 1 := by
  grind

-- Characteristic 256 means 16 * 16 = 0.
example [CommRing α] [IsCharP α 256] (x : α) :
    (x + 16) * (x - 16) = x^2 := by
  grind

-- Works on built-in rings such as `UInt8`.
example (x : UInt8) : (x + 16) * (x - 16) = x^2 := by
  grind

example [CommRing α] (a b c : α) :
    a + b + c = 3 →
    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 5 →
    a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 7 →
    a^4 + b^4 = 9 - c^4 := by
  grind

example [Field α] [NoNatZeroDivisors α] (a : α) :
    1 / a + 1 / (2 * a) = 3 / (2 * a) := by
  grind
```

**Other options**

- `grind (splits := <num>)` caps the *depth* of the search tree. Once a branch performs `num` splits `grind` stops splitting further in that branch.
- `grind -splitIte` disables case splitting on if-then-else expressions.
- `grind -splitMatch` disables case splitting on `match` expressions.
- `grind +splitImp` instructs `grind` to split on any hypothesis `A → B` whose antecedent `A` is **propositional**.
- `grind -linarith` disables the linear arithmetic solver for (ordered) modules and rings.

**Additional Examples**

```proofscript
example {a b} {as bs : List α} : (as ++ bs ++ [b]).getLastD a = b := by
  grind

example (x : BitVec (w+1)) : (BitVec.cons x.msb (x.setWidth w)) = x := by

The simplifier is described in greater detail in [its dedicated chapter](../../The-Simplifier/index.md#the-simplifier).

<a id="simp"></a>

**tactic**

```text
simp
```

The `simp` tactic uses lemmas and hypotheses to simplify the main goal target or non-dependent hypotheses. It has many variants:

- `simp` simplifies the main goal target using lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]`.
- `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]` and the given `hᵢ`'s, where the `hᵢ`'s are expressions.-
- If an `hᵢ` is a defined constant `f`, then `f` is unfolded. If `f` has equational lemmas associated with it (and is not a projection or a `reducible` definition), these are used to rewrite with `f`.
- `simp [*]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]` and all hypotheses.
- `simp only [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is like `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` but does not use `[simp]` lemmas.
- `simp [-id₁, ..., -idₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]`, but removes the ones named `idᵢ`.
- `simp at h₁ h₂ ... hₙ` simplifies the hypotheses `h₁ : T₁` ... `hₙ : Tₙ`. If the target or another hypothesis depends on `hᵢ`, a new simplified hypothesis `hᵢ` is introduced, but the old one remains in the local context.
- `simp at *` simplifies all the hypotheses and the target.
- `simp [*] at *` simplifies target and all (propositional) hypotheses using the other hypotheses.

```text
simpa

This is a "finishing" tactic modification of `simp`. It has two forms.

- `simpa [rules, ⋯] using e` will simplify the goal and the type of `e` using `rules`, then try to close the goal using `e`.

   

  Simplifying the type of `e` makes it more likely to match the goal (which has also been simplified). This construction also tends to be more robust under changes to the simp lemma set.

   

  The final match between the simplified `e` and the simplified goal uses **reducible** transparency, so it does not unfold semireducible definitions. Write `simpa [rules, ⋯] using! e` to perform the match at the ambient (default/semireducible) transparency instead.
- `simpa [rules, ⋯]` will simplify the goal and the type of a hypothesis `this` if present in the context, then try to close the goal using the `assumption` tactic.

As with `simp`, the `!` modifier after `simpa` enables auto-unfolding of definitions in the simp set.

### 14.5.14. Rewriting

**tactic**

rw
```

`rw` is like `rewrite`, but also tries to close the goal by "cheap" (reducible) `rfl` afterwards.

<a id="rewrite"></a>

**tactic**

```text
rewrite
```

`rewrite [e]` applies identity `e` as a rewrite rule to the target of the main goal. If `e` is preceded by left arrow (`←` or `<-`), the rewrite is applied in the reverse direction. If `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`.

- `rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` applies the given rules sequentially.
- `rewrite [e] at l` rewrites `e` at location(s) `l`, where `l` is either `*` or a list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter case, a turnstile `⊢` or `|-` can also be used, to signify the target of the goal.

Using `rw (occs := .pos L) [e]`, where `L : List Nat`, you can control which "occurrences" are rewritten. (This option applies to each rule, so usually this will only be used with a single rule.) Occurrences count from `1`. At each allowed occurrence, arguments of the rewrite rule `e` may be instantiated, restricting which later rewrites can be found. (Disallowed occurrences do not result in instantiation.) `(occs := .neg L)` allows skipping specified occurrences.

**inductive type**

```text
Lean.Meta.TransparencyMode : Type
```

Controls which constants `isDefEq` (definitional equality) and `whnf` (weak head normal form) are allowed to unfold.

**Background: "try-hard" vs "speculative" modes**

During **type checking of user input**, we assume the input is most likely correct, and we want Lean to try hard before reporting a failure. Here, it is fine to unfold `[semireducible]` definitions (the `.default` setting).

During **proof automation** (`simp`, `rw`, type class resolution), we perform many speculative `isDefEq` calls — most of which *fail*. In this setting, we do *not* want to try hard: unfolding too many definitions is a performance footgun. This is why `.reducible` exists.

**The transparency hierarchy**

The levels form a linear order: `none < reducible < instances < implicit < default < all`. Each level unfolds everything the previous level does, plus more:

- **`reducible`**: Only unfolds `[reducible]` definitions. Used for speculative `isDefEq` checks (e.g., discrimination tree lookups in `simp`, type class resolution). Think of `[reducible]` as `[inline]` for type checking and indexing.
- **`instances`**: Also unfolds `[instance_reducible]` definitions (auto-applied to type class instances by the `instance` command). Primarily but not exclusively used during type class synthesis when unifying an instance's type with the expected type. Constants that play a role in an instance's discrimination pattern must not be instance-reducible; they must at least be implicit-reducible. For example, if `id : α → α` was instance-reducible, under some circumstances an instance of type `C (id x)` can be applied when an instance of type `C x` is requested. If this is undesirable, `id` (in this example) should be at most implicit-reducible. Most users should follow a simple rule: Make declarations that are meant to return instances but were not declared using the `instance` command instance-reducible. Most users will never need to manually annotate anything else with `[instance_reducible]` and they should not unless they understand what they do. There are some more subtle corners of the elaborator where instance-reducible constants have a special role, such as in the lazy WHNF mechanism and the generation of `sizeOf` equational lemmas. `[instance_reducible]` also affects the compiler's specialization and inlining behavior.
- **`implicit`**: Also unfolds `[implicit_reducible]` definitions. Implicit arguments and instance arguments are always checked at implicit transparency, even if the ambient transparency is `reducible` or `instances`. It is usually cheaper to compare terms at implicit transparency than it is to compare them at default transparency (see below) because it is more restrictive at unfolding. Tactics such as `simp` unify lemmas with subterms at `reducible` transparency. For example, when `simp` applies a lemma to a subterm, it puts metavariables in the place of its parameters and then unifies the lemma's conclusion with the subterm at `reducible` transparency, bumping the transparency to `implicit` for implicit and instance arguments. When `simp` does not apply a lemma that it should, it can be because `simp` would need to unfold a semireducible declaration during the unification process. In that case, marking that declaration `[implicit_reducible]` can be a solution.

   

  `[implicit_reducible]` is the right annotation in several situations, such as the following ones.

   

  - Because instance arguments are always compared at (at least) implicit transparency, marking constants as `[implicit_reducible]` can prevent instance diamonds.
  - Operations used in type parameters (such as in the `n` of `Fin n`) should, as a basic rule, be implicit-reducible, at least as soon as `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency.types` is enabled, because types during metavariable assignments are then compared at implicit transparency.
  - The left-hand side and right-hand side of a `rfl` lemma should be definitionally equal at implicit transparency. Marking constants as `[implicit_reducible]` allows for more `rfl` lemmas.

   

  The downside is that every implicit-reducible constant makes the definitional equality checker do more unfolding, which can get expensive.
- **`default`**: Also unfolds `[semireducible]` definitions (anything not `[irreducible]`). Used for type checking user input where we want to try hard.
- **`all`**: Also unfolds `[irreducible]` definitions. Rarely used.

**Implicit arguments and transparency**

When proof automation (e.g., `simp`, `rw`) applies a lemma, explicit arguments are checked at the caller's transparency (typically `.reducible`). But implicit arguments are often "invisible" to the user — if a lemma fails to apply because of an implicit argument mismatch, the user is confused. Historically, Lean bumped transparency to `.default` for implicit arguments, but this eventually became a performance bottleneck in Mathlib. The option `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency true` (default: `true`) disables this bump. Instead, implicit arguments (`{..}`) and instance-implicit arguments (`[..]`) are checked at `.implicit` (so implicit-reducible definitions additionally unfold and instance diamonds resolve), or at the caller's transparency when `backward.isDefEq.implicitBump` is `false`.

See also: `ReducibilityStatus`, `backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency`, `backward.whnf.reducibleClassField`.

**Constructors**

**def**

Lean.Meta.Rewrite.NewGoals : Type

Controls which new mvars are turned in to goals by the `apply` tactic.

- `nonDependentFirst` mvars that don't depend on other goals appear first in the goal list.
- `nonDependentOnly` only mvars that don't depend on other goals are added to goal list.
- `all` all unassigned mvars are added to the goal list.

<a id="unfold"></a>

**tactic**

```text
unfold
```

- `unfold id` unfolds all occurrences of definition `id` in the target.
- `unfold id1 id2 ...` is equivalent to `unfold id1; unfold id2; ...`.
- `unfold id at h` unfolds at the hypothesis `h`.

Definitions can be either global or local definitions.

For non-recursive global definitions, this tactic is identical to `delta`. For recursive global definitions, it uses the "unfolding lemma" `id.eq_def`, which is generated for each recursive definition, to unfold according to the recursive definition given by the user. Only one level of unfolding is performed, in contrast to `simp only [id]`, which unfolds definition `id` recursively.

Implemented by `Lean.Elab.Tactic.evalUnfold`.

<a id="replace"></a>

**tactic**

```text
replace
```

`replace h := e` is like `have h := e`, but it removes a previous hypothesis of the same name as this one if possible. For example, if the state is:

```text
f : α → β
h : α
⊢ goal
```

Then after `replace h := f h` the state will be:

```text
f : α → β
h : β
⊢ goal
```

whereas `have h := f h` would result in:

```text
f : α → β
h† : α
h : β
⊢ goal
```

The tactic `specialize h a₁ ... aₙ` is a way to write `replace h := h a₁ ... aₙ`, automatically inferring which hypothesis should be replaced.

The `replace` tactic can be used to simulate Rocq's `apply at` tactic.

### 14.5.15. Inductive Types

#### 14.5.15.1. Introduction

<a id="constructor"></a>

**tactic**

```text
constructor
```

If the main goal's target type is an inductive type, `constructor` solves it with the first matching constructor, or else fails.

<a id="injection"></a>

**tactic**

```text
injection
```

The `injection` tactic is based on the fact that constructors of inductive data types are injections. That means that if `c` is a constructor of an inductive datatype, and if `(c t₁)` and `(c t₂)` are two terms that are equal then `t₁` and `t₂` are equal too. If `q` is a proof of a statement of conclusion `t₁ = t₂`, then injection applies injectivity to derive the equality of all arguments of `t₁` and `t₂` placed in the same positions. For example, from `(a::b) = (c::d)` we derive `a=c` and `b=d`. To use this tactic `t₁` and `t₂` should be constructor applications of the same constructor. Given `h : a::b = c::d`, the tactic `injection h` adds two new hypothesis with types `a = c` and `b = d` to the main goal. The tactic `injection h with h₁ h₂` uses the names `h₁` and `h₂` to name the new hypotheses.

<a id="injections"></a>

**tactic**

```text

`injections` applies `injection` to all hypotheses recursively (since `injection` can produce new hypotheses). Useful for destructing nested constructor equalities like `(a::b::c) = (d::e::f)`.

#### 14.5.15.2. Elimination

Elimination tactics use [recursors](../../The-Type-System/Inductive-Types/index.md#recursors) and the automatically-derived [`casesOn` helper](../../The-Type-System/Inductive-Types/index.md#recursor-elaboration-helpers) to implement induction and case splitting. The [subgoals](../index.md#--tech-term-subgoals) that result from these tactics are determined by the types of the minor premises of the eliminators, and using different eliminators with the `using` option results in different subgoals.

<a id="Choosing-Eliminators"></a>
Choosing Eliminators 

When attempting to prove that `∀(i : Fin (n + 1)), 0 + i = i`, after introducing the hypotheses the tactic `induction i` results in:

This is because `Fin` is a [structure](../../The-Type-System/Inductive-Types/index.md#--tech-term-Structures) with a single non-recursive constructor. Its recursor has a single minor premise for this constructor:

```proofscript
Fin.rec.{u} {n : Nat} {motive : Fin n → Sort u}
  (mk : (val : Nat) →
    (isLt : val < n) →
    motive ⟨val, isLt⟩)
  (t : Fin n) : motive t
```

Using the tactic `induction i using Fin.induction` instead results in:

`Fin.induction` is an alternative eliminator that implements induction on the underlying `Nat`:

```proofscript
Fin.induction.{u} {n : Nat}
  {motive : Fin (n + 1) → Sort u}
  (zero : motive 0)
  (succ : (i : Fin n) →
    motive i.castSucc →
    motive i.succ)
  (i : Fin (n + 1)) : motive i
```

<a id="--tech-term-Custom-eliminators"></a>
Custom eliminators can be registered using the `induction_eliminator` and `cases_eliminator` attributes. The eliminator is registered for its explicit targets (i.e. those that are explicit, rather than implicit, parameters to the eliminator function) and will be applied when `induction` or `cases` is used on targets of those types. When present, custom eliminators take precedence over recursors. Setting `tactic.customEliminators` to `false` disables the use of custom eliminators.

```text
cases
```

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type, `cases x` splits the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor. If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`, that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward, so that the case split affects that hypothesis as well. `cases` detects unreachable cases and closes them automatically.

For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `cases n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`, and one goal with hypothesis `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`. Here the name `a` is chosen automatically and is not accessible. You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.

- `cases e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal, and then cases on the resulting variable.
- Given `as : List α`, `cases as with | nil => tac₁ | cons a as' => tac₂`, uses tactic `tac₁` for the `nil` case, and `tac₂` for the `cons` case, and `a` and `as'` are used as names for the new variables introduced.
- `cases h : e`, where `e` is a variable or an expression, performs cases on `e` as above, but also adds a hypothesis `h : e = ...` to each goal, where `...` is the constructor instance for that particular case.

<a id="rcases"></a>

**tactic**

```text
rcases
```

`rcases` is a tactic that will perform `cases` recursively, according to a pattern. It is used to destructure hypotheses or expressions composed of inductive types like `h1 : a ∧ b ∧ c ∨ d` or `h2 : ∃ x y, trans_rel R x y`. Usual usage might be `rcases h1 with ⟨ha, hb, hc⟩ | hd` or `rcases h2 with ⟨x, y, _ | ⟨z, hxz, hzy⟩⟩` for these examples.

Each element of an `rcases` pattern is matched against a particular local hypothesis (most of which are generated during the execution of `rcases` and represent individual elements destructured from the input expression). An `rcases` pattern has the following grammar:

- A name like `x`, which names the active hypothesis as `x`.
- A blank `_`, which does nothing (letting the automatic naming system used by `cases` name the hypothesis).
- A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
- The keyword `rfl`, which expects the hypothesis to be `h : a = b`, and calls `subst` on the hypothesis (which has the effect of replacing `b` with `a` everywhere or vice versa).
- A type ascription `p : ty`, which sets the type of the hypothesis to `ty` and then matches it against `p`. (Of course, `ty` must unify with the actual type of `h` for this to work.)
- A tuple pattern `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`, which matches a constructor with many arguments, or a series of nested conjunctions or existentials. For example if the active hypothesis is `a ∧ b ∧ c`, then the conjunction will be destructured, and `p1` will be matched against `a`, `p2` against `b` and so on.
- A `@` before a tuple pattern as in `@⟨p1, p2, p3⟩` will bind all arguments in the constructor, while leaving the `@` off will only use the patterns on the explicit arguments.
- An alternation pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`, which matches an inductive type with multiple constructors, or a nested disjunction like `a ∨ b ∨ c`.

A pattern like `⟨a, b, c⟩ | ⟨d, e⟩` will do a split over the inductive datatype, naming the first three parameters of the first constructor as `a,b,c` and the first two of the second constructor `d,e`. If the list is not as long as the number of arguments to the constructor or the number of constructors, the remaining variables will be automatically named. If there are nested brackets such as `⟨⟨a⟩, b | c⟩ | d` then these will cause more case splits as necessary. If there are too many arguments, such as `⟨a, b, c⟩` for splitting on `∃ x, ∃ y, p x`, then it will be treated as `⟨a, ⟨b, c⟩⟩`, splitting the last parameter as necessary.

`rcases` also has special support for quotient types: quotient induction into Prop works like matching on the constructor `quot.mk`.

`rcases h : e with PAT` will do the same as `rcases e with PAT` with the exception that an assumption `h : e = PAT` will be added to the context.

<a id="fun_cases"></a>

**tactic**

```text
fun_cases
```

The `fun_cases` tactic is a convenience wrapper of the `cases` tactic when using a functional cases principle.

The tactic invocation

```text
fun_cases f x ... y ...`
```

is equivalent to

```text
cases y, ... using f.fun_cases_unfolding x ...
```

where the arguments of `f` are used as arguments to `f.fun_cases_unfolding` or targets of the case analysis, as appropriate.

The form

```proofscript
fun_cases f
```

(with no arguments to `f`) searches the goal for a unique eligible application of `f`, and uses these arguments. An application of `f` is eligible if it is saturated and the arguments that will become targets are free variables.

The form `fun_cases f x y with | case1 => tac₁ | case2 x' ih => tac₂` works like with `cases`.

Under `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding true` (the default), `fun_induction` uses the `f.fun_cases_unfolding` theorem, which will try to automatically unfold the call to `f` in the goal. With `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding false`, it uses `f.fun_cases` instead.

<a id="induction"></a>

**tactic**

```text
induction
```

Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type, `induction x` applies induction on `x` to the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor and an inductive hypothesis is added for each recursive argument to the constructor. If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`, that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward, so that the inductive hypothesis incorporates that hypothesis as well.

For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`, `induction n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`, and one goal with hypotheses `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and `ih₁ : P a → Q a` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`. Here the names `a` and `ih₁` are chosen automatically and are not accessible. You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.

- `induction e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the resulting variable.
- `induction e using r` allows the user to specify the principle of induction that should be used. Here `r` should be a term whose result type must be of the form `C t`, where `C` is a bound variable and `t` is a (possibly empty) sequence of bound variables
- `induction e generalizing z₁ ... zₙ`, where `z₁ ... zₙ` are variables in the local context, generalizes over `z₁ ... zₙ` before applying the induction but then introduces them in each goal. In other words, the net effect is that each inductive hypothesis is generalized.
- Given `x : Nat`, `induction x with | zero => tac₁ | succ x' ih => tac₂` uses tactic `tac₁` for the `zero` case, and `tac₂` for the `succ` case.

The tactic `nofun` is shorthand for `exact nofun`: it introduces the assumptions, then performs an empty pattern match, closing the goal if the introduced pattern is impossible.

### 14.5.16. Library Search

The library search tactics are intended for interactive use. When run, they search the Lean library for lemmas or rewrite rules that could be applicable in the current situation, and suggests a new tactic. These tactics should not be left in a proof; rather, their suggestions should be incorporated.

<a id="exact___"></a>

**tactic**

```text
exact?
```

Searches environment for definitions or theorems that can solve the goal using `exact` with conditions resolved by `solve_by_elim`.

The optional `using` clause provides identifiers in the local context that must be used by `exact?` when closing the goal. This is most useful if there are multiple ways to resolve the goal, and one wants to guide which lemma is used.

Use `+grind` to enable `grind` as a fallback discharger for subgoals. Use `+try?` to enable `try?` as a fallback discharger for subgoals. Use `-star` to disable fallback to star-indexed lemmas (like `Empty.elim`, `And.left`). Use `+all` to collect all successful lemmas instead of stopping at the first.

<a id="apply___"></a>

**tactic**

```text
apply?
```

Searches environment for definitions or theorems that can refine the goal using `apply` with conditions resolved when possible with `solve_by_elim`.

The optional `using` clause provides identifiers in the local context that must be used when closing the goal.

Use `+grind` to enable `grind` as a fallback discharger for subgoals. Use `+try?` to enable `try?` as a fallback discharger for subgoals. Use `-star` to disable fallback to star-indexed lemmas. Use `+all` to collect all successful lemmas instead of stopping at the first.

In this proof state:

invoking `apply?` suggests:

```lean
Try this:
  [apply] exact Nat.lt_trans h1 h2
```

<a id="rw___"></a>

**tactic**

```text
rw?
```

`rw?` tries to find a lemma which can rewrite the goal.

`rw?` should not be left in proofs; it is a search tool, like `apply?`.

Suggestions are printed as `rw [h]` or `rw [← h]`.

You can use `rw? [-my_lemma, -my_theorem]` to prevent `rw?` using the named lemmas.

<a id="tactic-ref-cases"></a>
### 14.5.17. Case Analysis

<a id="split"></a>

**tactic**

```text
split
```

The `split` tactic is useful for breaking nested if-then-else and `match` expressions into separate cases. For a `match` expression with `n` cases, the `split` tactic generates at most `n` subgoals.

For example, given `n : Nat`, and a target `if n = 0 then Q else R`, `split` will generate one goal with hypothesis `n = 0` and target `Q`, and a second goal with hypothesis `¬n = 0` and target `R`. Note that the introduced hypothesis is unnamed, and is commonly renamed using the `case` or `next` tactics.

- `split` will split the goal (target).
- `split at h` will split the hypothesis `h`.

<a id="by_cases"></a>

**tactic**

```text
by_cases
```

`by_cases (h :)? p` splits the main goal into two cases, assuming `h : p` in the first branch, and `h : ¬ p` in the second branch.

<a id="tactic-ref-decision"></a>
### 14.5.18. Decision Procedures

<a id="decide"></a>

**tactic**

```text
decide
```

`decide` attempts to prove the main goal (with target type `p`) by synthesizing an instance of `Decidable p` and then reducing that instance to evaluate the truth value of `p`. If it reduces to `isTrue h`, then `h` is a proof of `p` that closes the goal.

The target is not allowed to contain local variables or metavariables. If there are local variables, you can first try using the `revert` tactic with these local variables to move them into the target, or you can use the `+revert` option, described below.

Options:

- `decide +revert` begins by reverting local variables that the target depends on, after cleaning up the local context of irrelevant variables. A variable is *relevant* if it appears in the target, if it appears in a relevant variable, or if it is a proposition that refers to a relevant variable.
- `decide +kernel` uses kernel for reduction instead of the elaborator. It has two key properties: (1) since it uses the kernel, it ignores transparency and can unfold everything, and (2) it reduces the `Decidable` instance only once instead of twice.
- `decide +native` uses the native code compiler (`#eval`) to evaluate the `Decidable` instance, admitting the result via an axiom. This can be significantly more efficient than using reduction, but it is at the cost of increasing the size of the trusted code base. Namely, it depends on the correctness of the Lean compiler and all definitions with an `@[implemented_by]` attribute. Like with `+kernel`, the `Decidable` instance is evaluated only once.

Limitation: In the default mode or `+kernel` mode, since `decide` uses reduction to evaluate the term, `Decidable` instances defined by well-founded recursion might not work because evaluating them requires reducing proofs. Reduction can also get stuck on `Decidable` instances with `Eq.rec` terms. These can appear in instances defined using tactics (such as `rw` and `simp`). To avoid this, create such instances using definitions such as `decidable_of_iff` instead.

**Examples**

Proving inequalities:

```proofscript
example : 2 + 2 ≠ 5 := by decide
```

Trying to prove a false proposition:

```text
example : 1 ≠ 1 := by decide
/-
tactic 'decide' proved that the proposition
  1 ≠ 1
is false
-/
```

Trying to prove a proposition whose `Decidable` instance fails to reduce

```text
opaque unknownProp : Prop

open scoped Classical in
example : unknownProp := by decide
/-
tactic 'decide' failed for proposition
  unknownProp
since its 'Decidable' instance reduced to
  Classical.choice ⋯
rather than to the 'isTrue' constructor.
-/
```

**Properties and relations**

For equality goals for types with decidable equality, usually `rfl` can be used in place of `decide`.

```proofscript
example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by decide
example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by rfl
```

<a id="native_decide"></a>

**tactic**

```text
native_decide
```

`native_decide` is a synonym for `decide +native`. It will attempt to prove a goal of type `p` by synthesizing an instance of `Decidable p` and then evaluating it to `isTrue ..`. Unlike `decide`, this uses `#eval` to evaluate the decidability instance.

This should be used with care because it adds the entire lean compiler to the trusted part, and a new axiom will show up in `#print axioms` for theorems using this method or anything that transitively depends on them. Nevertheless, because it is compiled, this can be significantly more efficient than using `decide`, and for very large computations this is one way to run external programs and trust the result.

```proofscript
example : (List.range 1000).length = 1000 := by native_decide
```

<a id="omega"></a>

**tactic**

```text
omega
```

The `omega` tactic, for resolving integer and natural linear arithmetic problems.

It is not yet a full decision procedure (no "dark" or "grey" shadows), but should be effective on many problems.

We handle hypotheses of the form `x = y`, `x < y`, `x ≤ y`, and `k ∣ x` for `x y` in `Nat` or `Int` (and `k` a literal), along with negations of these statements.

We decompose the sides of the inequalities as linear combinations of atoms.

If we encounter `x / k` or `x % k` for literal integers `k` we introduce new auxiliary variables and the relevant inequalities.

On the first pass, we do not perform case splits on natural subtraction. If `omega` fails, we recursively perform a case split on a natural subtraction appearing in a hypothesis, and try again.

The options

```text
omega +splitDisjunctions +splitNatSub +splitNatAbs +splitMinMax
```

can be used to:

- `splitDisjunctions`: split any disjunctions found in the context, if the problem is not otherwise solvable.
- `splitNatSub`: for each appearance of `((a - b : Nat) : Int)`, split on `a ≤ b` if necessary.
- `splitNatAbs`: for each appearance of `Int.natAbs a`, split on `0 ≤ a` if necessary.
- `splitMinMax`: for each occurrence of `min a b`, split on `min a b = a ∨ min a b = b`

Currently, all of these are on by default.

<a id="bv_omega"></a>

**tactic**

```text
bv_omega
```

`bv_omega` is `omega` with an additional preprocessor that turns statements about `BitVec` into statements about `Nat`. Currently the preprocessor is implemented as `try simp only [bitvec_to_nat] at *`. `bitvec_to_nat` is a `@[simp]` attribute that you can (cautiously) add to more theorems.

<a id="tactic-ref-sat"></a>
#### 14.5.18.1. SAT Solver Integration

<a id="bv_decide"></a>

**tactic**

```text
bv_decide
```

Close fixed-width `BitVec` and `Bool` goals by obtaining a proof from an external SAT solver and verifying it inside Lean. The solvable goals are currently limited to

- the Lean equivalent of [`QF_BV`](https://smt-lib.org/logics-all.shtml#QF_BV)
- automatically splitting up `structure`s that contain information about `BitVec` or `Bool`

```proofscript
example : ∀ (a b : BitVec 64), (a &&& b) + (a ^^^ b) = a ||| b := by
  intros
  bv_decide
```

If `bv_decide` encounters an unknown definition it will be treated like an unconstrained `BitVec` variable. Sometimes this enables solving goals despite not understanding the definition because the precise properties of the definition do not matter in the specific proof.

If `bv_decide` fails to close a goal it provides a counter-example, containing assignments for all terms that were considered as variables.

In order to avoid calling a SAT solver every time, the proof can be cached with `bv_decide?`.

If solving your problem relies inherently on using associativity or commutativity, consider enabling the `bv.ac_nf` option.

`bv_decide types [T₁, ..., Tₙ]` restricts the analysis of structures and enum inductives to `T₁, ..., Tₙ`, treating all other ones as opaque variables.

Note: `bv_decide` trusts the correctness of the code generator and adds a axioms asserting its result.

Note: include `import Std.Tactic.BVDecide`

<a id="bv_normalize"></a>

**tactic**

```text
bv_normalize
```

Run the normalization procedure of `bv_decide` only. Sometimes this is enough to solve basic `BitVec` goals already.

Note: include `import Std.Tactic.BVDecide`

<a id="bv_check"></a>

**tactic**

```text
bv_check
```

This tactic works just like `bv_decide` but skips calling a SAT solver by using a proof that is already stored on disk. It is called with the name of an LRAT file in the same directory as the current Lean file:

```proofscript
bv_check "proof.lrat"
```

<a id="bv_decide___"></a>

**tactic**

```text
bv_decide?
```

Suggest a proof script for a `bv_decide` tactic call. Useful for caching LRAT proofs.

Note: include `import Std.Tactic.BVDecide`

<a id="tactic-ref-cbv"></a>
### 14.5.19. Call-by-Value Evaluation

The `cbv` tactic simulates call-by-value evaluation to reduce terms. In 
<a id="--tech-term-call-by-value-evaluation"></a>
call-by-value evaluation, the arguments to a function are reduced to values before the function call is reduced. Roughly speaking, *values* are either functions or applications of constructors to values; the body of a function does not need to be a value for the function itself to count as a value. This evaluation strategy matches the execution order of code produced by the Lean compiler, which makes it a good match for code that is written to perform well at run time.

`cbv` unfolds definitions using their [equational lemmas](../../Elaboration-and-Compilation/index.md#--tech-term-equational-lemmas) and applies similar theorems that are automatically proved for [matcher functions](../../Elaboration-and-Compilation/index.md#--tech-term-matcher-functions), producing propositional equality proofs at each step. Because the unfolding is propositional rather than definitional, `cbv` can reduce functions defined via [well-founded recursion](../../Definitions/Recursive-Definitions/index.md#well-founded-recursion) or [partial fixpoints](../../Definitions/Recursive-Definitions/index.md#partial-fixpoint). In general, these functions are not definitionally equal to their unfoldings, so the kernel's definitional reduction does not reduce their recursive calls.

The proofs produced by `cbv` only use the three standard axioms (`propext`, `Quot.sound`, and `Classical.choice`). In particular, they do not require trust in the correctness of the code generator, unlike `native_decide`.

Because `cbv` rewrites subterms via `congrArg` and `congrFun`, it cannot rewrite subterms that appear in dependent positions. Rewriting the argument of a dependent function would change the type of subsequent arguments, and even with heterogeneous equality there are no suitable congruence lemmas for arbitrary dependent functions.

When reducing constant applications, `cbv` tries the following strategies in order:

1. Custom `cbv_eval` rewrite rules
2. [Equational lemmas](../../Elaboration-and-Compilation/index.md#--tech-term-equational-lemmas) (e.g., `foo.eq_1`, `foo.eq_2`)
3. Unfolding equations
4. Kernel matcher reduction

Declarations marked with `cbv_opaque` are never unfolded unless a matching `cbv_eval` rewrite rule is provided.

<a id="tactic"></a>

**syntax**

**Call-by-Value Evaluation**

<a id="Lean___Parser___Tactic___cbv"></a>

```ebnf
tactic ::= ...
    | cbv (at (term | locationType)*)?
```

<a id="cbv"></a>

**tactic**

```text
cbv
```

`cbv` performs simplification that closely mimics call-by-value evaluation. It reduces terms by unfolding definitions using their defining equations and applying matcher equations. The unfolding is propositional, so `cbv` also works with functions defined via well-founded recursion or partial fixpoints.

`cbv` reduces the goal type (and optionally hypothesis types) using call-by-value evaluation. For equation goals (`lhs = rhs`), `cbv` automatically attempts `refl` after reduction to close the goal.

`cbv` supports the standard `at` location syntax:

- `cbv` — reduce the goal target
- `cbv at h` — reduce hypothesis `h`
- `cbv at h |-` — reduce hypothesis `h` and the goal target
- `cbv at *` — reduce the goal target and all non-dependent propositional hypotheses

If a hypothesis reduces to `False`, the goal is closed immediately.

`cbv` is not a finishing tactic in general: it may leave a new (simpler) goal.

The proofs produced by `cbv` only use the three standard axioms. In particular, they do not require trust in the correctness of the code generator.

<a id="Reducing-Well-Founded-Recursive-Functions"></a>
Reducing Well-Founded Recursive Functions 

The function `countdown` is defined using well-founded recursion, so it is not definitionally equal to its unfolding. Ordinary `rfl` cannot close the goal:

<!-- Presentation aliases only; canonical source retained in the edit ledger. -->

<a id="countdown-_LPAR_in-Reducing-Hypotheses_RPAR_"></a>

<a id="countdown-_LPAR_in-Opaque-Definitions-with--____LSQ_cbv_opaque_RSQ__RPAR_"></a>


```proofscript
function countdown (n : Nat) : List Nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => [0]
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) :: countdown n
termination_by n
```

```proofscript
example : countdown 3 = [3, 2, 1, 0] := by rfl
```

```lean
Tactic `rfl` failed: The left-hand side
  countdown 3
is not definitionally equal to the right-hand side
  [3, 2, 1, 0]

⊢ countdown 3 = [3, 2, 1, 0]
```

The `cbv` tactic can reduce `countdown 3` via propositional rewriting and then close the equation goal via `rfl`:

```proofscript
example : countdown 3 = [3, 2, 1, 0] := by
  cbv
```

<a id="Reducing-Hypotheses"></a>
Reducing Hypotheses 

The `cbv` tactic supports the standard `at` location syntax. When used with `at h`, it reduces the type of hypothesis `h`. When used with `at *`, it reduces all non-dependent propositional hypotheses and the goal target.

<!-- Presentation aliases only; canonical source retained in the edit ledger. -->

```proofscript
function countdown (n : Nat) : List Nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => [0]
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) :: countdown n
termination_by n
```

```proofscript
example (x : List Nat) (h : x = countdown 2) :
    x = [2, 1, 0] := by
  cbv at h
  exact h
```

<a id="cbv--as-a-Non-Finishing-Tactic"></a>
`cbv` as a Non-Finishing Tactic 

Unlike `decide`, `cbv` is not a terminal tactic. It simplifies the goal as much as possible but may leave a goal that requires further reasoning. Here, `cbv` reduces the call to `countdown` but leaves the membership goal:

<!-- Presentation aliases only; canonical source retained in the edit ledger. -->

```proofscript
function countdown (n : Nat) : List Nat :=
  match n with
  | 0 => [0]
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) :: countdown n
termination_by n
```

```proofscript
example : 1 ∈ countdown 2 := by
  cbv
```

```lean
unsolved goals
⊢ List.Mem 1 [2, 1, 0]

<a id="Dependent-Positions"></a>
Dependent Positions 

The function `wfLength` is a version of `List.length` that is defined via [well-founded recursion](../../Definitions/Recursive-Definitions/index.md#--tech-term-well-founded-recursion) instead of [structural recursion](../../Definitions/Recursive-Definitions/index.md#structural-recursion). As a result, it is [irreducible](../../Definitions/Recursive-Definitions/index.md#--tech-term-Irreducible):
<a id="wfLength-_LPAR_in-Dependent-Positions_RPAR_"></a>


```proofscript
def wfLength : List Nat → Nat
  | [] => 0
  | _ :: xs => wfLength xs + 1
termination_by xs => xs
```

In a non-dependent `Std.TreeMap`, `cbv` can reduce the computed key `wfLength [1, 2]`:

<!-- Presentation aliases only; canonical source retained in the edit ledger. -->
<a id="myTreeMap-_LPAR_in-Dependent-Positions_RPAR_"></a>


```proofscript
const myTreeMap : Std.TreeMap Nat Nat :=
  .empty |>.insert (wfLength [1, 2]) 42

example : myTreeMap.toList = [⟨2, 42⟩] := by
  cbv
```

However, consider a dependent tree map `FinMap` that maps each key `n` to a value of type `Fin (n + 1)`:
<a id="FinMap-_LPAR_in-Dependent-Positions_RPAR_"></a>


```proofscript
abbrev FinMap :=
  Std.DTreeMap Nat (fun n => Fin (n + 1))
```

Here `cbv` gets stuck because the value type `Fin (n + 1)` depends on the key:

```proofscript
example :
    let m : FinMap :=
      .empty |>.insert (wfLength [1, 2])
        ⟨0, by decide_cbv⟩
    m.toList = [⟨2, ⟨0, by omega⟩⟩] := by
  cbv
```

#### 14.5.19.1. decide_cbv

<a id="decide_cbv"></a>

**tactic**

```text
decide_cbv
```

`decide_cbv` is a finishing tactic that closes goals of the form `p`, where `p` is a `Decidable` proposition. It proceeds in two steps:

1. Apply `of_decide_eq_true` to transform the goal into `decide p = true`.
2. Reduce `decide p` via call-by-value normalization. If the result is definitionally equal to `true`, the goal is closed.

`decide_cbv` fails with an error if `decide p` does not reduce to `true`. Unlike `cbv`, `decide_cbv` is a terminal tactic: it either closes the goal or fails.

The proofs produced by `decide_cbv` only use the three standard axioms. In particular, they do not require trust in the correctness of the code generator.

<a id="decide_cbv-next"></a>
`decide_cbv` 

The `decide_cbv` tactic closes goals that are decidable propositions by reducing the `Decidable` instance via [call-by-value evaluation](index.md#--tech-term-call-by-value-evaluation):

```proofscript
example : 2 + 3 = 5 ∧ 10 < 20 := by
  decide_cbv
```

Unlike `native_decide`, `decide_cbv` does not require trust in the code generator. Unlike `decide`, which uses definitional reduction, `decide_cbv` can handle functions defined by [well-founded recursion](../../Definitions/Recursive-Definitions/index.md#well-founded-recursion):
<a id="isAllPositive-_LPAR_in-decide_cbv_RPAR_"></a>


```proofscript
def isAllPositive : List Int → Bool
  | [] => true
  | x :: xs => x > 0 && isAllPositive xs

  decide_cbv
```

<a id="Prime-Power-Testing-with--decide_cbv"></a>
Prime Power Testing with `decide_cbv` 

Because `decide_cbv` uses propositional unfolding, it can evaluate complex decision procedures involving [well-founded recursive](../../Definitions/Recursive-Definitions/index.md#well-founded-recursion) functions. Here, `Nat.minFac` finds the smallest divisor of a number, while the helper `minFacAux` searches for the smallest odd divisor:

<!-- Presentation aliases only; canonical source retained in the edit ledger. -->
<a id="minFacAux-_LPAR_in-Prime-Power-Testing-with--decide_cbv_RPAR_"></a>
<a id="Nat___minFac-_LPAR_in-Prime-Power-Testing-with--decide_cbv_RPAR_"></a>


```proofscript
function minFacAux (n k : Nat) : Nat :=
  if h : n < k * k then n
  else
    if h' : k ∣ n then k
    else
      have : k ≤ n := by
        have := Nat.le_mul_self k; grind
      minFacAux n (k + 2)
termination_by n + 2 - k

function Nat.minFac (n : Nat) : Nat :=
  if 2 ∣ n then 2 else minFacAux n 3
```

`Nat.log b n` computes the floor of the base-`b` logarithm of `n` by repeated squaring:

```proofscript

  go : Nat → Nat → Nat × Nat

  | b, fuel + 1 =>
    if n < b then (n, 0)
    else
      let (q, e) := go (b * b) fuel
      if q < b then
        (q, 2 * e)
      else
        (q / b, 2 * e + 1)
```

Here, `decide_cbv` can reduce the result of the decision procedure even though there is a free variable `k`:

```proofscript
example : ¬∃ k,
    k ≤ Nat.log 2 15151515151515 ∧
    0 < k ∧

**attribute**

**Custom cbv Rewrite Rules**

The `cbv_eval` attribute registers a theorem as a custom rewrite rule that `cbv` applies before trying [equational lemmas](../../Elaboration-and-Compilation/index.md#--tech-term-equational-lemmas). The theorem must be an unconditional equality; one side (generally the left-hand side) must be an application of a constant.

<a id="Lean___Parser___Attr___cbv_eval"></a>

```ebnf
attr ::= ...
    | cbv_eval
```

The `←` modifier instructs `cbv` to apply the rule from right to left:

```ebnf

```

<a id="cbv_eval"></a>
`cbv_eval` 

Custom rewrite rules can be used to control how `cbv` evaluates specific functions. For instance, the naïve definition of reversal, `slowReverse`, has quadratic complexity due to repeated use of `List.append`. By providing a tail-recursive characterization via `fastReverse`, `cbv` can evaluate `slowReverse` efficiently:

**Opaque Declarations for cbv**

The `cbv_opaque` attribute prevents `cbv` from unfolding a declaration using its [equational lemmas](../../Elaboration-and-Compilation/index.md#--tech-term-equational-lemmas) or unfold theorems. However, `cbv_eval` rewrite rules always take priority over `cbv_opaque`: if a matching `cbv_eval` rule exists for a declaration, it will be applied even if the declaration is marked `cbv_opaque`. This allows replacing the default unfolding behavior with a controlled set of evaluation rules.

##### 14.5.19.2.1. Custom Simplification Procedures

A 
<a id="--tech-term-cbv-simplification-procedure"></a>
cbv simplification procedure (`cbv` simproc) is a user-defined metaprogram that `cbv` invokes on subexpressions matching a given pattern. While `cbv_eval` rules are limited to static equality, `cbv` simprocs can perform arbitrary computation to decide how to rewrite a subexpression. Common use cases include defining procedures for evaluating functions on literal values or short-circuiting control flow.

The simprocs used by `cbv` have type `Lean.Meta.Sym.Simp.Simproc`, which is distinct from the `Lean.Meta.Simp.Simproc` type used by the `simp` tactic. The two systems are independent: registering a `cbv` simproc has no effect on `simp`, and vice versa.

**syntax**

**Custom cbv Simplification Procedures**

The body must have type `Simproc` (that is, `Expr → SimpM Result`). The pattern is an expression with holes (`_`) that determines which subexpressions trigger the procedure. Patterns are matched agains subexpressions structurally after unfolding reducible definitions and applying [β](../../The-Type-System/index.md#--tech-term-___)-, [η](../../The-Type-System/index.md#--tech-term-___-equivalence)-, and [ζ](../../The-Type-System/index.md#--tech-term-___-next-next-next)-reduction to both sides. Matching is modulo α-equivalence (bound variable names are ignored), and proof and instance arguments in the pattern are treated as wildcards. An optional phase specifier controls when the procedure fires during normalization. When no phase is specified, the default is `↑` (post).

  `↓` (pre)

Fires on each subexpression *before* `cbv` reduces it. The arguments are still unreduced. Use this phase to override `cbv`'s default call-by-value evaluation order. A typical use case would be to evaluate arguments lazily or to short-circuit evaluation (as the built-in `ite` and `Or` procedures do).

  `cbv_eval` (eval)

Fires *after* arguments have been reduced to values, but *before* the function is unfolded. Use this phase to provide efficient ground evaluation procedures.

  `↑` (post, default)

Fires *after* `cbv` has attempted standard reduction (equation lemmas, unfolding, kernel matching). Use this phase when standard reduction should be tried first.

```ebnf
command ::= ...

An optional phase specifier can be placed before the name:

<a id="Declaring-a--cbv_simproc"></a>
Declaring a `cbv_simproc` 

A simplification procedure is declared by providing a pattern and a body of type `Lean.Meta.Sym.Simp.Simproc`. The pattern is an expression with holes (`_`) that determines which subexpressions trigger the procedure. Here, the pattern is (`myConst _`), which matches any application of `myConst`. The procedure (`fun _e => do return .rfl`) ignores the expression, returning a result that indicates that no rewriting is to be performed.
<a id="myConst-_LPAR_in-Declaring-a--cbv_simproc_RPAR_"></a>
<a id="evalMyConst-_LPAR_in-Declaring-a--cbv_simproc_RPAR_"></a>


```proofscript
opaque myConst : Nat → Nat

open Lean Meta Sym.Simp in
cbv_simproc evalMyConst (myConst _) := fun _e => do
  -- A real simproc would inspect `e`, compute a result,
  -- and return `.step result proof`.
  return .rfl
```

The [`cbv_simproc_decl`](index.md#Lean___Parser____FLQQ_command_Cbv_simproc_decl__LPAR___RPAR_________FLQQ_) variant declares the procedure without activating it. The `cbv_simproc` attribute can be used to activate it later, optionally at a specific phase:

<a id="Lazy-evaluation-of-a-head-of-the-list"></a>
Lazy evaluation of a head of the list 

This is an example of a pre-phase simplification procedure that breaks the conventional call-by-value order of evaluation to achieve laziness. The `↓` modifier ensures that `evalListHead` fires before the arguments to `List.head?` are evaluated. It rewrites `List.head? (a :: as)` to `some a` using `List.head?_cons`, discarding the tail `as` without evaluating it. Only the head element `a` is subsequently reduced by `cbv`.
<a id="evalListHead-_LPAR_in-Lazy-evaluation-of-a-head-of-the-list_RPAR_"></a>
<a id="cbv_simproc_test-_LPAR_in-Lazy-evaluation-of-a-head-of-the-list_RPAR_"></a>


```proofscript
cbv_simproc ↓ evalListHead (List.head? _) := fun e => do
  let_expr List.head? α listExpr := e | return .rfl
  let_expr List.cons _ a as := listExpr | return .rfl
  let Level.succ u ← Sym.getLevel α | return .rfl
  let result ← Sym.share <| mkApp2 (mkConst ``Option.some [u]) α a
  let proof := mkApp3 (mkConst ``List.head?_cons [u]) α a as
  return .step result proof

theorem cbv_simproc_test : [5 + 5,6].head? = .some 10 := by cbv
```

Inspecting the proof term confirms that the simplification procedure fired: `List.head?_cons` appears directly in the proof, showing that `cbv` used the simproc's rewrite rather than reducing `List.head?` by unfolding its definition.

```lean
theorem cbv_simproc_test : [5 + 5, 6].head? = some 10 :=
of_eq_true
  (Eq.trans (congrFun' (congrArg Eq (Eq.trans List.head?_cons (congrArg some (Eq.refl 10)))) (some 10))
    (eq_self (some 10)))
```

Lean includes a number of built-in simplification procedures for `cbv`. These handle control flow (`ite`, `dite`, `cond`, `Decidable.decide`, `Decidable.rec`), logical connectives (`Or`, `And`), and data structure operations (array indexing, string operations). The control flow procedures use the `↓` (pre) phase to enable short-circuit evaluation, while the array and string procedures use the `cbv_eval` phase to reduce ground applications directly.

`with_reducible tacs` executes `tacs` using the reducible transparency setting. In this setting only definitions tagged as `[reducible]` are unfolded.

<a id="with_reducible_and_instances-next"></a>

**tactic**

```text
with_reducible_and_instances

<a id="with_unfolding_none"></a>

**tactic**

```text
with_unfolding_none

`with_unfolding_none tacs` executes `tacs` using the `.none` transparency setting. In this setting no definitions are unfolded.

<a id="tactic-ref-control"></a>
### 14.5.21. Control Flow

<a id="skip"></a>

**tactic**

```text
skip
```

`skip` does nothing.

<a id="guard_hyp"></a>

**tactic**

```text
guard_hyp
```

Tactic to check that a named hypothesis has a given type and/or value.

- `guard_hyp h : t` checks the type up to reducible defeq,
- `guard_hyp h :~ t` checks the type up to default defeq,
- `guard_hyp h :ₛ t` checks the type up to syntactic equality,
- `guard_hyp h :ₐ t` checks the type up to alpha equality.
- `guard_hyp h := v` checks value up to reducible defeq,
- `guard_hyp h :=~ v` checks value up to default defeq,
- `guard_hyp h :=ₛ v` checks value up to syntactic equality,
- `guard_hyp h :=ₐ v` checks the value up to alpha equality.

The value `v` is elaborated using the type of `h` as the expected type.

<a id="guard_target"></a>

**tactic**

```text
guard_target
```

Tactic to check that the target agrees with a given expression.

- `guard_target = e` checks that the target is defeq at reducible transparency to `e`.
- `guard_target =~ e` checks that the target is defeq at default transparency to `e`.
- `guard_target =ₛ e` checks that the target is syntactically equal to `e`.
- `guard_target =ₐ e` checks that the target is alpha-equivalent to `e`.

The term `e` is elaborated with the type of the goal as the expected type, which is mostly useful within `conv` mode.

<a id="guard_expr"></a>

**tactic**

```text
guard_expr
```

Tactic to check equality of two expressions.

- `guard_expr e = e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are defeq at reducible transparency.
- `guard_expr e =~ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are defeq at default transparency.
- `guard_expr e =ₛ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are syntactically equal.
- `guard_expr e =ₐ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are alpha-equivalent.

Both `e` and `e'` are elaborated then have their metavariables instantiated before the equality check. Their types are unified (using `isDefEqGuarded`) before synthetic metavariables are processed, which helps with default instance handling.

<a id="done"></a>

**tactic**

```text
done
```

`done` succeeds iff there are no remaining goals.

<a id="sleep"></a>

**tactic**

```text
sleep
```

The tactic `sleep ms` sleeps for `ms` milliseconds and does nothing. It is used for debugging purposes only.

<a id="stop"></a>

**tactic**

```text
stop
```

`stop` is a helper tactic for "discarding" the rest of a proof: it is defined as `repeat sorry`. It is useful when working on the middle of a complex proofs, and less messy than commenting the remainder of the proof.

<a id="tactic-ref-term-helpers"></a>
### 14.5.22. Term Elaboration Backends

These tactics are used during elaboration of terms to satisfy obligations that arise.

<a id="decreasing_with"></a>

**tactic**

```text
decreasing_with
```

Constructs a proof of decreasing along a well founded relation, by simplifying, then applying lexicographic order lemmas and finally using `ts` to solve the base case. If it fails, it prints a message to help the user diagnose an ill-founded recursive definition.

<a id="get_elem_tactic"></a>

**tactic**

```text
get_elem_tactic
```

`get_elem_tactic` is the tactic automatically called by the notation `arr[i]` to prove any side conditions that arise when constructing the term (e.g. the index is in bounds of the array). It just delegates to `get_elem_tactic_extensible` and gives a diagnostic error message otherwise; users are encouraged to extend `get_elem_tactic_extensible` instead of this tactic.

<a id="get_elem_tactic_trivial"></a>

**tactic**

```text
get_elem_tactic_trivial
```

`get_elem_tactic_trivial` has been deprecated in favour of `get_elem_tactic_extensible`.

<a id="tactic-ref-debug"></a>
### 14.5.23. Debugging Utilities

<a id="sorry"></a>

**tactic**

```text
sorry
```

The `sorry` tactic is a temporary placeholder for an incomplete tactic proof, closing the main goal using `exact sorry`.

This is intended for stubbing-out incomplete parts of a proof while still having a syntactically correct proof skeleton. Lean will give a warning whenever a proof uses `sorry`, so you aren't likely to miss it, but you can double check if a theorem depends on `sorry` by looking for `sorryAx` in the output of the `#print axioms my_thm` command, the axiom used by the implementation of `sorry`.

<a id="admit"></a>

**tactic**

```text
admit
```

`admit` is a synonym for `sorry`.

<a id="dbg_trace"></a>

**tactic**

```text
dbg_trace
```

`dbg_trace "foo"` prints `foo` when elaborated. Useful for debugging tactic control flow:

```proofscript
example : False ∨ True := by
  first
  | apply Or.inl; trivial; dbg_trace "left"
  | apply Or.inr; trivial; dbg_trace "right"
```

<a id="trace_state"></a>

**tactic**

```text
trace_state
```

`trace_state` displays the current state in the info view.

<a id="trace"></a>

**tactic**

```text
trace
```

`trace msg` displays `msg` in the info view.

<a id="The-Lean-Language-Reference--Tactic-Proofs--Tactic-Reference--Suggestions"></a>
### 14.5.24. Suggestions

<a id="___-next"></a>

**tactic**

```text
∎
```

`∎` (typed as `\qed`) is a macro that expands to `try?` in tactic mode.

<a id="suggestions"></a>

**tactic**

```text
suggestions
```

`#suggestions` will suggest relevant theorems from the library for the current goal, using the currently registered library suggestion engine.

The suggestions are printed in the order of their confidence, from highest to lowest.

<a id="tactic-ref-other"></a>
### 14.5.25. Other

<a id="trivial"></a>

**tactic**

```text
trivial
```

`trivial` tries different simple tactics (e.g., `rfl`, `contradiction`, ...) to close the current goal. You can use the command `macro_rules` to extend the set of tactics used. Example:

```proofscript
macro_rules | `(tactic| trivial) => `(tactic| simp)
```

<a id="solve"></a>

**tactic**

```text
solve
```

Similar to `first`, but succeeds only if one the given tactics solves the current goal.

<a id="and_intros"></a>

**tactic**

```text
and_intros
```

`and_intros` applies `And.intro` until it does not make progress.

<a id="infer_instance"></a>

**tactic**

```text
infer_instance
```

`infer_instance` is an abbreviation for `exact inferInstance`. It synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass inference.

<a id="expose_names"></a>

**tactic**

```text
expose_names
```

`expose_names` renames all inaccessible variables with accessible names, making them available for reference in generated tactics. However, this renaming introduces machine-generated names that are not fully under user control. `expose_names` is primarily intended as a preamble for auto-generated end-game tactic scripts. It is also useful as an alternative to `set_option tactic.hygienic false`. If explicit control over renaming is needed in the middle of a tactic script, consider using structured tactic scripts with `match .. with`, `induction .. with`, or `intro` with explicit user-defined names, as well as tactics such as `next`, `case`, and `rename_i`.

<a id="unhygienic"></a>

**tactic**

```text
unhygienic
```

`unhygienic tacs` runs `tacs` with name hygiene disabled. This means that tactics that would normally create inaccessible names will instead make regular variables. **Warning**: Tactics may change their variable naming strategies at any time, so code that depends on autogenerated names is brittle. Users should try not to use `unhygienic` if possible.

```proofscript
example : ∀ x : Nat, x = x := by unhygienic
  intro            -- x would normally be intro'd as inaccessible
  exact Eq.refl x  -- refer to x
```

<a id="run_tac"></a>

**tactic**

```text
run_tac
```

The `run_tac doSeq` tactic executes code in `TacticM Unit`.

<a id="tactic-ref-mvcgen"></a>
### 14.5.26. Verification Condition Generation

<a id="mvcgen"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mvcgen
```

`mvcgen` will break down a Hoare triple proof goal like `⦃P⦄ prog ⦃Q⦄` into verification conditions, provided that all functions used in `prog` have specifications registered with `@[spec]`.

**Verification Conditions and specifications**

A verification condition is an entailment in the stateful logic of `Std.Do.SPred` in which the original program `prog` no longer occurs. Verification conditions are introduced by the `mspec` tactic; see the `mspec` tactic for what they look like. When there's no applicable `mspec` spec, `mvcgen` will try and rewrite an application `prog = f a b c` with the simp set registered via `@[spec]`.

**Features**

When used like `mvcgen +noLetElim [foo_spec, bar_def, instBEqFloat]`, `mvcgen` will additionally

- add a Hoare triple specification `foo_spec : ... → ⦃P⦄ foo ... ⦃Q⦄` to `spec` set for a function `foo` occurring in `prog`,
- unfold a definition `def bar_def ... := ...` in `prog`,
- unfold any method of the `instBEqFloat : BEq Float` instance in `prog`.
- it will no longer substitute away `let`-expressions that occur at most once in `P`, `Q` or `prog`.

**Config options**

`+noLetElim` is just one config option of many. Check out `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.VCGen.Config` for all options. Of particular note is `stepLimit = some 42`, which is useful for bisecting bugs in `mvcgen` and tracing its execution.

**Extended syntax**

Often, `mvcgen` will be used like this:

```text
mvcgen [...]
case inv1 => exact I1
case inv2 => exact I2
all_goals (mleave; try grind)
```

There is special syntax for this:

```text
mvcgen [...] invariants
· I1
· I2
with grind
```

When `I1` and `I2` need to refer to inaccessibles (`mvcgen` will introduce a lot of them for program variables), you can use case label syntax:

```text
mvcgen [...] invariants
| inv1 _ acc _ => I1 acc
| _ => I2
with grind
```

This is more convenient than the equivalent `· by rename_i _ acc _; exact I1 acc`.

**Invariant suggestions**

`mvcgen` will suggest invariants for you if you use the `invariants?` keyword.

```text
mvcgen [...] invariants?
```

This is useful if you do not recall the exact syntax to construct invariants. Furthermore, it will suggest a concrete invariant encoding "this holds at the start of the loop and this must hold at the end of the loop" by looking at the corresponding VCs. Although the suggested invariant is a good starting point, it is too strong and requires users to interpolate it such that the inductive step can be proved. Example:

```text
def mySum (l : List Nat) : Nat := Id.run do
  let mut acc := 0
  for x in l do
    acc := acc + x
  return acc

/--
info: Try this:
  invariants
    · ⇓⟨xs, letMuts⟩ => ⌜xs.prefix = [] ∧ letMuts = 0 ∨ xs.suffix = [] ∧ letMuts = l.sum⌝
-/
#guard_msgs (info) in
theorem mySum_suggest_invariant (l : List Nat) : mySum l = l.sum := by
  generalize h : mySum l = r
  apply Id.of_wp_run_eq h
  mvcgen invariants?
  all_goals admit

##### 14.5.26.1.1. Starting and Stopping the Proof Mode

<a id="mstart"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mstart
```

Start the stateful proof mode of `Std.Do.SPred`. This will transform a stateful goal of the form `H ⊢ₛ T` into `⊢ₛ H → T` upon which `mintro` can be used to re-introduce `H` and give it a name. It is often more convenient to use `mintro` directly, which will try `mstart` automatically if necessary.

<a id="mstop"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mstop
```

Stops the stateful proof mode of `Std.Do.SPred`. This will simply forget all the names given to stateful hypotheses and pretty-print a bit differently.

<a id="mleave"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mleave
```

Leaves the stateful proof mode of `Std.Do.SPred`, tries to eta-expand through all definitions related to the logic of the `Std.Do.SPred` and gently simplifies the resulting pure Lean proposition. This is often the right thing to do after `mvcgen` in order for automation to prove the goal.

##### 14.5.26.1.2. Proving a Stateful Goal

<a id="mspec"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mspec
```

`mspec` is an `apply`-like tactic that applies a Hoare triple specification to the target of the stateful goal.

Given a stateful goal `H ⊢ₛ wp⟦prog⟧ Q'`, `mspec foo_spec` will instantiate `foo_spec : ... → ⦃P⦄ foo ⦃Q⦄`, match `foo` against `prog` and produce subgoals for the verification conditions `?pre : H ⊢ₛ P` and `?post : Q ⊢ₚ Q'`.

- If `prog = x >>= f`, then `mspec Specs.bind` is tried first so that `foo` is matched against `x` instead. Tactic `mspec_no_bind` does not attempt to do this decomposition.
- If `?pre` or `?post` follow by `.rfl`, then they are discharged automatically.
- `?post` is automatically simplified into constituent `⊢ₛ` entailments on success and failure continuations.
- `?pre` and `?post.*` goals introduce their stateful hypothesis under an inaccessible name. You can give it a name with the `mrename_i` tactic.
- Any uninstantiated MVar arising from instantiation of `foo_spec` becomes a new subgoal.
- If the target of the stateful goal looks like `fun s => _` then `mspec` will first `mintro ∀s`.
- If `P` has schematic variables that can be instantiated by doing `mintro ∀s`, for example `foo_spec : ∀(n:Nat), ⦃fun s => ⌜n = s⌝⦄ foo ⦃Q⦄`, then `mspec` will do `mintro ∀s` first to instantiate `n = s`.
- Right before applying the spec, the `mframe` tactic is used, which has the following effect: Any hypothesis `Hᵢ` in the goal `h₁:H₁, h₂:H₂, ..., hₙ:Hₙ ⊢ₛ T` that is pure (i.e., equivalent to some `⌜φᵢ⌝`) will be moved into the pure context as `hᵢ:φᵢ`.

Additionally, `mspec` can be used without arguments or with a term argument:

- `mspec` without argument will try and look up a spec for `x` registered with `@[spec]`.
- `mspec (foo_spec blah ?bleh)` will elaborate its argument as a term with expected type `⦃?P⦄ x ⦃?Q⦄` and introduce `?bleh` as a subgoal. This is useful to pass an invariant to e.g., `Specs.forIn_list` and leave the inductive step as a hole.

<a id="mintro"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mintro
```

Like `intro`, but introducing stateful hypotheses into the stateful context of the `Std.Do.SPred` proof mode. That is, given a stateful goal `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)* ⊢ₛ P → T`, `mintro h` transforms into `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)*, (h : P) ⊢ₛ T`.

Furthermore, `mintro ∀s` is like `intro s`, but preserves the stateful goal. That is, `mintro ∀s` brings the topmost state variable `s:σ` in scope and transforms `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)* ⊢ₛ T` (where the entailment is in `Std.Do.SPred (σ::σs)`) into `(hᵢ : Hᵢ s)* ⊢ₛ T s` (where the entailment is in `Std.Do.SPred σs`).

Beyond that, `mintro` supports the full syntax of `mcases` patterns (`mintro pat = (mintro h; mcases h with pat`), and can perform multiple introductions in sequence.

<a id="mexact"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mexact

`mexact` is like `exact`, but operating on a stateful `Std.Do.SPred` goal.

```text

```

<a id="massumption"></a>

<a id="mrefine"></a>

Like `refine`, but operating on stateful `Std.Do.SPred` goals.

```text

<a id="mspecialize"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mspecialize

`mspecialize` is like `specialize`, but operating on a stateful `Std.Do.SPred` goal. It specializes a hypothesis from the stateful context with hypotheses from either the pure or stateful context or pure terms.

```text
example (P Q : SPred σs) : P ⊢ₛ (P → Q) → Q := by
  mintro HP HPQ
  mspecialize HPQ HP

example (y : Nat) (P Q : SPred σs) (Ψ : Nat → SPred σs) (hP : ⊢ₛ P) : ⊢ₛ Q → (∀ x, P → Q → Ψ x) → Ψ (y + 1) := by

  mspecialize HΨ (y + 1) hP HQ
  mexact HΨ
```

<a id="mspecialize_pure"></a>

**tactic**

`mspecialize_pure` is like `mspecialize`, but it specializes a hypothesis from the *pure* context with hypotheses from either the pure or stateful context or pure terms.

```text
example (y : Nat) (P Q : SPred σs) (Ψ : Nat → SPred σs) (hP : ⊢ₛ P) (hΨ : ∀ x, ⊢ₛ P → Q → Ψ x) : ⊢ₛ Q → Ψ (y + 1) := by

  mspecialize_pure (hΨ (y + 1)) hP HQ => HΨ
  mexact HΨ
```

<a id="mcases"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mcases
```

Like `rcases`, but operating on stateful `Std.Do.SPred` goals. Example: Given a goal `h : (P ∧ (Q ∨ R) ∧ (Q → R)) ⊢ₛ R`, `mcases h with ⟨-, ⟨hq | hr⟩, hqr⟩` will yield two goals: `(hq : Q, hqr : Q → R) ⊢ₛ R` and `(hr : R) ⊢ₛ R`.

That is, `mcases h with pat` has the following semantics, based on `pat`:

- `pat=□h'` renames `h` to `h'` in the stateful context, regardless of whether `h` is pure
- `pat=⌜h'⌝` introduces `h' : φ` to the pure local context if `h : ⌜φ⌝` (c.f. `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.ProofMode.IsPure`)
- `pat=h'` is like `pat=⌜h'⌝` if `h` is pure (c.f. `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.ProofMode.IsPure`), otherwise it is like `pat=□h'`.
- `pat=_` renames `h` to an inaccessible name
- `pat=-` discards `h`
- `⟨pat₁, pat₂⟩` matches on conjunctions and existential quantifiers and recurses via `pat₁` and `pat₂`.
- `⟨pat₁ | pat₂⟩` matches on disjunctions, matching the left alternative via `pat₁` and the right alternative via `pat₂`.

<a id="mrename_i"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mrename_i
```

`mrename_i` is like `rename_i`, but names inaccessible stateful hypotheses in a `Std.Do.SPred` goal.

<a id="mpure"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mpure
```

`mpure` moves a pure hypothesis from the stateful context into the pure context.

```text
example (Q : SPred σs) (ψ : φ → ⊢ₛ Q): ⌜φ⌝ ⊢ₛ Q := by
  mintro Hφ
  mpure Hφ
  mexact (ψ Hφ)
```

<a id="mframe"></a>

**tactic**

```text
mframe
```

`mframe` infers which hypotheses from the stateful context can be moved into the pure context. This is useful because pure hypotheses "survive" the next application of modus ponens (`Std.Do.SPred.mp`) and transitivity (`Std.Do.SPred.entails.trans`).

It is used as part of the `mspec` tactic.

```text
example (P Q : SPred σs) : ⊢ₛ ⌜p⌝ ∧ Q ∧ ⌜q⌝ ∧ ⌜r⌝ ∧ P ∧ ⌜s⌝ ∧ ⌜t⌝ → Q := by
  mintro _
  mframe
  /- `h : p ∧ q ∧ r ∧ s ∧ t` in the pure context -/
  mcases h with hP
  mexact h
```

### Display 1


```text
`cbv` performs simplification that closely mimics call-by-value evaluation.
It reduces terms by unfolding definitions using their defining equations and
applying matcher equations. The unfolding is propositional, so `cbv` also works
with functions defined via well-founded recursion or partial fixpoints.

`cbv` reduces the goal type (and optionally hypothesis types) using call-by-value
evaluation. For equation goals (`lhs = rhs`), `cbv` automatically attempts `refl`
after reduction to close the goal.

`cbv` supports the standard `at` location syntax:
- `cbv` — reduce the goal target
- `cbv at h` — reduce hypothesis `h`
- `cbv at h |-` — reduce hypothesis `h` and the goal target
- `cbv at *` — reduce the goal target and all non-dependent propositional hypotheses

If a hypothesis reduces to `False`, the goal is closed immediately.

`cbv` is not a finishing tactic in general: it may leave a new (simpler) goal.

The proofs produced by `cbv` only use the three standard axioms.
In particular, they do not require trust in the correctness of the code
generator.
```


### Display 2


```text
Location specifications are used by many tactics that can operate on either the
hypotheses or the goal. It can have one of the forms:
* 'empty' is not actually present in this syntax, but most tactics use
  `(location)?` matchers. It means to target the goal only.
* `at h₁ ... hₙ`: target the hypotheses `h₁`, ..., `hₙ`
* `at h₁ h₂ ⊢`: target the hypotheses `h₁` and `h₂`, and the goal
* `at *`: target all hypotheses and the goal
```
